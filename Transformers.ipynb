      "We report a novel allele at the arylsulfatase A (ARSA) locus causing late-onset metachromatic leukodystrophy (MLD). In this allele, arginine84, a highly conserved residue in the arylsulfatase gene family, is replaced by glutamine. Unlike alleles that cause early MLD, substitution of arginine84 for glutamine is associated with some residual ARSA activity. A comparison of genotypes, ARSA activities, and clinical data on 4 individuals carrying the allele from 81 MLD patients examined further validates the concept that different degrees of residual ARSA activity underlie the Phenotypic variation in MLD.\n",
      "Classic phenylketonuria is an autosomal recessive disorder caused by hepatic phenylalanine hydroxylase (PAH) deficiency. The abolition of an invariant BamHI site located in the coding sequence of the PAH gene (exon 7) led to the recognition of two new point mutations at codons 272 and 273 (272gly----stop and 273ser--- -phe, respectively). Both mutations were detected in the north-east of France or in Belgium and occurred against a background of alleles of the 7 RFLP haplotype. The present study supports the idea that the clinical heterogeneity of PKU is explained by the wide variety of mutant genotypes associated with PAH deficiencies.\n",
      "The metabolism of the cardioselective beta-blocker metoprolol is under debrisoquine/sparteine ​​genetic control. The two metabolic phenotypes, extensive (EM) and poor metabolizers (PM), exhibit different stereoselective metabolism, resulting in apparently higher beta-1 adrenergic receptor antagonistic potency of racemic metoprolol in EM. We examined whether the latter also applies to beta-2 adrenergic receptor antagonism by metoprolol. The drug effect studied was the antagonism of metoprolol against terbutaline-induced hypokalemia. Using pharmacodynamic pharmacokinetic modeling, the pharmacodynamics of racemic metoprolol and the active S isomer were quantified in EM and PM in terms of IC50 values, representing plasma concentrations of metoprolol resulting in half-maximal receptor occupancy. Six EMs received 0.5 mg of terbutaline s.c. on two different occasions: 1) 1 hour after the administration of a placebo and 2) 1 hour after 150 mg of metoprolol p.o. Five PMs were studied according to the same protocol, at with the exception of a higher dose of terbutaline (0.75 mg) on ​​day 2. Blood samples for analysis of plasma potassium, terbutaline, metoprolol (racemic, R and S isomer) and l 'alpha-Hydroxymetoprolol concentrations were taken at regular intervals, for 8 hours after metoprolol. In PM, metoprolol increased the area under the plasma concentration-time curve of terbutaline (+67%). Higher metoprolol/alpha-hydroxymetoprolol ratios in PM were predictive of higher R-/S isomer ratios of unchanged drug. There was a difference in the potency of metoprolol with higher racemic IC50 values ​​in PM (72 +/- 7 ng.ml-1) than in EM (42 +/- 8 ng.ml-1, P less than 0.001). (SUMMARY TRUNCATED TO 250 WORDS)\n",
      "Previous experiments in this laboratory have shown that microinjection of methyldopa onto ventrolateral cells of serotonergic B3 neurons in the spinal cord causes a hypotensive response mediated by a projection down the spinal cord. The present experiments were designed to investigate the role of midcells of B3 serotonergic neurons in the medulla, coinciding with raphe magnus. In spontaneously hypertensive and stroke-prone rats, microinjection of methyldopa into the area of ​​the middle group of serotonergic B3 cells of the ventral medulla caused potent hypotension of 30 to 40 mm Hg, which was maximal 2 to 3 hours after administration and abolished by the serotonergic neurotoxin 5,7-dihydroxytryptamine (5,7-DHT) injected intracerebroventricular. However, intraspinal injection of 5,7-DHT to produce a more selective lesion of only descending serotonin projections in the spinal cord did not affect this hypotension. Furthermore, 5,7-DHT injury of serotonergic nerves traveling in the medial forebrain bundle, one of the major ascending pathways from serotonergic B3 cells, did not affect the associated drop in blood pressure to a median serotonin B3 injection of methyldopa. We therefore conclude that, unlike ventrolateral B3 cells which mediate methyldopa-induced hypotension via descending projections, midline serotonergic B3 cells contribute to the hypotensive action of methyldopa, either through an ascending projection which does not pass through the median bundle of the forebrain, or by a projection limited to the caudal brainstem.\n",
      "Eighty unrelated individuals with Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) or Becker muscular dystrophy (BMD) had deletions in the core deletion-rich region of the DMD locus. This region includes the last five exons detected by cDNA5b-7, all exons detected by cDNA8, and the first two exons detected by cDNA9. These 80 individuals represent approximately 75% of the 109 gene deletions detected among 181 patients analyzed with the entire dystrophin cDNA. The parameters of many of these deletions were further characterized using two genomic probes, p20 (DXS269; Wapenaar et al.) and GMGX11 (DXS239; this article). The clinical results are presented for all 80 patients allowing a correlation between phenotypic severity and genotype. Thirty-eight independent patients were old enough to be classified as DMD, BMD, or intermediate phenotype and had exon deletions with sequenced intron/exon boundaries. Among them, eight DMD patients and one intermediate patient had genetic deletions likely to leave the reading frame intact, while 21 DMD patients, 7 intermediate patients, and 1 BMD patient had genetic deletions likely to disrupt the reading frame. Thus, with two exceptions, frameshift deletions of the gene resulted in a more severe phenotype than in-frame deletions. This is in agreement with recent findings by Baumbach et al. and Koenig et al. but this contrasts with the results of Malhotra et al. at the 5' end of the gene.\n",
      "Serious cardiovascular complications occurred in eight of 160 patients treated with terbutaline for premature labor. Associated corticosteroid therapy and twin gestations appear to be predisposing factors. Potential mechanisms of pathophysiology are briefly discussed.\n",
      "Two overlapping cDNA clones (1,991 bp and 736 bp, respectively) encoding the human mitochondrial very long-chain acyl-coenzyme A dehydrogenase (VLCAD) precursor were cloned and sequenced. The cDNA inserts from these clones together encompass a region of 2,177 bases, encoding the entire protein of 655 amino acids, including a leader peptide of 40 amino acids and a mature polypeptide of 615 amino acids. PCR-amplified VLCAD cDNAs were sequenced in cultured fibroblasts from two VLCAD-deficient patients. In both patients, a 105 bp deletion encompassing bases 1078-1182 in the VLCAD cDNA was identified. The deletion appears to occur due to exon skipping during processing of VLCAD pre-mRNA. This is the first demonstration of a mutation causing VLCAD deficiency. Quantitative expression of normal human VLCAD cDNA was carried out in patient fibroblasts, using the vaccinia viral system, which demonstrated that deficiency of normal VLCAD protein causes impairment of VLCAD activity. beta-oxidation of long-chain fatty acids in patient fibroblasts. In patient fibroblasts, increasing VLCAD activity to approximately 20% of the normal activity of control fibroblasts increased the flux of palmitic acid beta-oxidation to the level found in control fibroblasts, which may offer important insights for the rational design of future somatic gene therapy for VLCAD deficiency.\n",
      "A human mu opiate receptor cDNA was identified from a cerebral cortex cDNA library using sequences from the rat mu opiate receptor cDNA. The human mu opiate receptor (h mu OR1) shares 95% amino acid identity with the rat sequence. Expressed mu OR1 recognized opiate drugs and tested opioid peptides in a sodium- and GTP-sensitive manner with affinities virtually identical to those displayed by the rat mu opiate receptor. The effects on cyclic AMP are similar to those observed for the rat mu opiate receptor. An 18 kb genomic clone hybridizing with h mu OR1 cDNA contains exonic sequences of 63 and 489 bp flanked by donor/acceptor splicing sequences. Hybridization analysis to DNA prepared from human rodent hybrid cell lines and chromosomal in situ hybridization studies indicate localization at 6q24-25. An MspI polymorphism, producing a band of 3.7 kb, could prove useful to evaluate the involvement of this gene in neuropsychiatric disorders involving the opiatergic systems.\n",
      "We identified 14 families with ataxia-telangiectasia (A-T) in which the ATM gene mutation is associated with a less severe clinical and cellular phenotype (approximately 10-15% of A-T families identified in the UK). . In 10 of these families, all homozygotes have a 137 bp insertion in their cDNA caused by a point mutation in a sequence resembling a splice donor site. The second A-T allele has a different mutation in each patient. We show that the less severe phenotype in these patients is due to some degree of normal splicing, which occurs as an alternative product from the allele containing the insertion. The level of the 137-bp PCR product containing the insertion was lowest in two patients with later-onset cerebellar ataxia. Four other families who do not benefit from this integration have been identified. The mutations detected in two of them are missense mutations, normally rare in A-T patients. The demonstration of mutations giving rise to a slightly milder phenotype in A-T raises the interesting question of what range of phenotypes might arise in individuals in whom both mutations are milder. One possibility could be that compound heterozygous individuals for ATM mutations are more common than we think.\n",
      "Nefiracetam is a novel pyrrolidone derivative that attenuates scopolamine-induced post-training learning and consolidation deficits. Since apomorphine inhibits passive avoidance retention when administered during training or in a defined period of 10 to 12 hours after training, we evaluated the ability of nefiracetam to attenuate induced amnesia by dopamine agonism. A progressive passive avoidance paradigm was used and nefiracetam (3 mg/kg) and apomorphine (0.5 mg/kg) were administered alone or in combination during training and during the consolidation period of 10 at 12 hours after training. Co-administration of nefiracetam and apomorphine during training or 10 hours after training produced no significant anti-amnestic effects. However, administering nefiracetam during training completely reversed apomorphine-induced amnesia 10 hours after training and the reverse was also true. These effects were not mediated by a dopaminergic mechanism since nefiracetam, at millimolar concentrations, failed to displace the binding of [3H]SCH 23390 or [3H]spiperine from dopamine D1 receptor subtypes or D2, respectively. Nefiracetam is suggested to increase molecular processes in the early stages of events that ultimately lead to memory consolidation.\n",
      "Myotonic dystrophy (DM), the most common muscle disorder in adults, is caused by the n-repeat (CTG) expansion of a gene encoding a protein kinase (DM protein kinase; DMPK) and involves changes of cytoarchitecture and ionic homeostasis. To obtain clues about the normal biological role of DMPK in cellular ion homeostasis, we compared resting [Ca2+]i, the amplitude and shape of depolarization-induced Ca2+ transients, and the content of ATP-driven ion pumps in cultured skeletal cells. muscle cells from wild-type and DMPK [-/-] knockout mice. In vitro differentiated DMPK[-/-] myotubes exhibit higher resting [Ca2+]i than wild-type myotubes due to altered open probability of voltage-gated l-type Ca2+ and Na+ channels . Mutant myotubes exhibit smaller and slower Ca2+ responses when triggered by acetylcholine or high external K+. Furthermore, we observed that these Ca2+ transients result in part from an influx of extracellular Ca2+ through the l-type Ca2+ channel. Neither the content nor the activity of Na+/K+ ATPase and sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2+-ATPase are affected by the absence of DMPK. In conclusion, our data suggest that DMPK is involved in modulating the initial events of excitation-contraction coupling in skeletal muscle.\n",
      "NADH: Ubiquinone oxidoreductase (complex I) of the mitochondrial respiratory chain can be fragmented into a subfraction of flavoprotein (FP), iron-sulfur protein (IP), and hydrophobic protein (HP). The IP subfraction is assumed to be significant, as it contains important prosthetic groups that are highly conserved among species. We cloned the cDNA of three remaining human NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase subunits from this IP fraction: NDUFS2 (49 kDa), NDUFS3 (30 kDa), and NDUFS6 (13 kDa). All cDNAs presented include the complete open reading frame (ORF), consisting of 1,392, 795, and 375 base pairs, encoding 463, 264, and 124 amino acids, respectively. The latter present 96, 90 and 83% homology with the corresponding bovine translation products. The 3' untranslated regions (UTRs) are complete in all three cDNAs. Polymerase chain reaction performed with DNA isolated from human-rodent somatic cell hybrids containing defined human chromosomes as template yielded a human-specific signal that mapped the NDUFS2 and NDUFS3 subunits to the chromosomes 1 and 11, respectively. In the case of the NDUFS6 subunit, a pseudogene may be present since signals were observed in the bands containing chromosomes 5 and 6. NDUFS2 contains a highly conserved protein kinase C phosphorylation site and the subunit NDUFS3 contains a highly conserved casein kinase II phosphorylation site which makes them strong candidates for future mutation detection studies in enzyme complex I deficient patients.\n",
      "A healthy 17-year-old male received standard intermittent doses of pethidine via a patient-controlled analgesia (PCA) pump for management of postoperative pain control. Twenty-three hours after surgery, he developed a brief, self-limiting seizure. Both plasma pethidine and norpethidine were elevated in the range associated with clinical manifestations of central nervous system excitation. No other risk factors for CNS toxicity have been identified. This method allowed frequent self-dosing of pethidine at short intervals and rapid accumulation of pethidine and norpethidine. The routine use of pethidine via PCA, even for brief postoperative analgesia, should be reconsidered.\n",
      "Carbamazepine and vigabatrin are contraindicated in typical absence seizures. Of 18 consecutive referrals of children presenting only resistant typical absences, eight were mistakenly treated with carbamazepine, either as monotherapy or as an adjunct. Vigabatrin was also used in the treatment of two children. The frequency of absences increased in four children treated with carbamazepine and two of them developed myoclonic jerks, which disappeared when carbamazepine treatment was stopped. The absences were worsened in both cases when vigabatrin was added to concomitant treatment. Optimal absence control was achieved with sodium valproate, lamotrigine or ethosuximide alone or in combination.\n",
      "Hepatocyte nuclear transcription factor (HNF)-6 is an upstream regulator of several genes involved in the pathogenesis of mature-onset diabetes in the young. We therefore tested the hypothesis that HNF-6 gene variability is associated with subsets of type II (non-insulin-dependent) diabetes mellitus and estimates of insulin secretion in tolerant subjects. glucose.   We cloned the coding region as well as the intron-exon boundaries of the HNF-6 gene. We then examined them on genomic DNA in six MODY candidates without mutations in MODY1, MODY3 and MODY4 genes and in 54 patients with late-onset type II diabetes by combined single-stranded conformational polymorphism-heteroduplex analysis followed by direct sequencing of identified variants. One missense variant identified was examined in association studies and genotype-phenotype studies.   We identified two silent variants and one missense variant (Pro75 Ala). In an association study, the allele frequency of the Pro75Ala polymorphism was 3.2% (95% confidence interval, 1.9-4.5) in 330 patients with type II diabetes mellitus compared to 4.2 % (2.4-6.0) in 238 age-matched glucose tolerant control subjects. . Moreover, in studies involving 238 middle-aged glucose-tolerant subjects, 226 glucose-tolerant descendants of type II diabetic patients, and 367 young healthy subjects, carriers of the polymorphism did not differ from non-carriers in terms glucose-induced serum insulin or C-peptide responses.   Mutations in the coding region of the HNF-6 gene are not associated with type II diabetes or changes in insulin responses to glucose in examined Caucasians.\n",
      "We identified a Ca2+-dependent type II lectin with mannose-binding specificity, exclusively expressed by Langerhans cells (LC), and named Langerin. LCs are uniquely characterized by Birbeck granules (BG), which are organelles consisting of overlapping, zip-like membranes. Here, we showed that Langerin is constitutively associated with BG and that antibodies against Langerin are internalized into these structures. Remarkably, transfection of Langerin cDNA into fibroblasts created a compact network of membrane structures exhibiting typical features of BG. Langerin is therefore a powerful inducer of membrane and zipper superposition leading to the formation of BG. Our data suggest that blood glucose induction is a consequence of the antigen-capture function of Langerin, enabling its trafficking to these organelles and providing access to a non-classical antigen processing pathway.\n",
      "We undertook a hospital-based study to identify possible founder mutations of BRCA1 and BRCA2 in the Polish population. The study group consisted of 66 Polish cancer families who had at least three female relatives with breast or ovarian cancer and were diagnosed with cancer, in at least one of the three affected women , at an age < 50 years. A total of 26 families had both breast cancer and ovarian cancer, 4 families had ovarian cancer only, and 36 families had breast cancer only. Genomic DNA was prepared from peripheral blood leukocytes of at least one affected woman from each family. The entire coding region of BRCA1 and BRCA2 was screened for the presence of germline mutations, using SSCP followed by direct sequencing of the observed variants. Mutations were found in 35 (53%) of the 66 families studied. All but one of the mutations were detected in the BRCA1 gene. BRCA1 abnormalities were identified in all four families with ovarian cancer only, in 67% of 27 families with both breast and ovarian cancer, and in 34% of 35 families. with breast cancer only. The only family with a BRCA2 mutation suffered from breast and ovarian cancer syndrome. Seven distinct mutations were identified; five of these occurred in two or more families. In total, recurrent mutations were found in 33 (94%) of 35 families with detected mutations. Three BRCA1 abnormalities – 5382insC, C61G and 4153delA – accounted for 51%, 20% and 11% of the identified mutations, respectively.\n",
      "Apomorphine was the first dopaminergic drug ever used to treat the symptoms of Parkinson's disease. While potent antiparkinsonian effects had been observed as early as 1951, the potential for treating fluctuating Parkinson's disease by subcutaneous administration of apomorphine has only recently been systematically studied. A number of small-scale clinical trials have shown unequivocally that intermittent subcutaneous injections of apomorphine produce an antiparkinsonian benefit close to, if not identical to, that observed with levodopa and that rescue injections of apomorphine can reverse reliably off-periods, even in patients with complex on-off motor oscillations. Continuous subcutaneous infusions of apomorphine can reduce daily downtime by more than 50% in this group of patients, which appears to be a stronger effect than that typically seen with adjunctive treatment with dopamine agonists oral or COMT inhibitors. Extended follow-up studies of up to 8 years have demonstrated long-term persistence of apomorphine's effectiveness. Additionally, there is compelling clinical evidence that monotherapy with continuous subcutaneous infusions of apomorphine is associated with a marked reduction in pre-existing levodopa-induced dyskinesias. The main side effects of subcutaneous apomorphine treatment are related to skin tolerance problems, while sedation and psychiatric complications play a lesser role. Given the marked degree of effectiveness of subcutaneous apomorphine treatment in fluctuating Parkinson's disease, this approach appears to merit broader clinical use.\n",
      "A novel cDNA homolog of Rab6, Rab6c, was discovered by a hypermethylated DNA fragment probe that was isolated from a multidrug-resistant (MDR) human breast cancer cell line, MCF7/AdrR, by the assay technique differences in representation sensitive to methylation (MS-RDA). Rab6c was found to be underexpressed in MCF7/AdrR and MES-SA/Dx5 (an MDR human uterine sarcoma cell line) compared to their parental non-MDR cell lines. MCF7/AdrR cells expressing exogenous Rab6c showed less resistance to several anticancer drugs, such as doxorubicin (DOX), taxol, vinblastine, and vincristine, than control cells containing the empty vector. Flow cytometry experiments confirmed that the decreased resistance of transfectants to DOX was due to increased drug accumulation induced by exogenous Rab6c. These results indicate that Rab6c is involved in drug resistance in MCF7/AdrR cells.\n",
      "BACKGROUND: The calcineurin inhibitors cyclosporine and tacrolimus are both known to be nephrotoxic. Their use in orthotopic liver transplantation (OLTX) has significantly improved success rates. Recently, however, we have seen an increase in the number of patients presenting after OLTX with end-stage renal disease (ESRD). This retrospective study examines the incidence and treatment of ESRD and chronic kidney disease (CKD) in OLTX patients. METHODS: Patients who received OLTX only from June 1985 to December 1994 and survived 6 months postoperatively were studied (n = 834). Our prospectively collected database was the source of information. Patients were divided into three groups: controls, without CRF or ESRD, n = 748; CRF, sustained serum creatinine > 2.5 mg/dL, n = 41; and ESRD, n = 45. Groups were compared for preoperative laboratory variables, diagnosis, postoperative variables, survival, ESRD treatment type, and survival from ESRD initiation. RESULTS: 13 years after OLTX, the incidence of severe renal dysfunction was 18.1% (CRF 8.6% and ESRD 9.5%). Compared to control patients, CKD and ESRD patients had higher preoperative serum creatinine levels, a higher percentage of patients with hepatorenal syndrome, a higher percentage of dialysis requirements during the First 3 months postoperatively and higher serum creatinine at one year. A stepwise multivariate logistic regression analysis using preoperative and postoperative variables identified that an increase in serum creatinine above the mean at 1 year, 3 months, and 4 weeks postoperatively were independent risk factors for the development of CKD or ESRD with odds ratios of 2.6, 2.2, and 1.6, respectively. Overall survival from the time of OLTX was not significantly different between groups, but at year 13, survival for patients with ESRD was only 28.2%, compared to 54.6%. in the control group. Patients developing ESRD had a 6-year survival after the start of ESRD of 27% for hemodialysis patients compared to 71.4% for patients developing ESRD and subsequently receiving a kidney transplant. CONCLUSIONS: Patients who are more than 10 years post-OLTX have a high rate of CKD and ESRD. The development of ESRD decreases survival, particularly in patients treated with dialysis alone. Patients who develop ESRD have higher preoperative and one-year serum creatinine and are more likely to have hepatorenal syndrome. However, increased serum creatinine at different postoperative time points is more predictive of the development of CKD or ESRD. New long-term immunosuppression strategies may be necessary to reduce this complication.\n",
      "More than 100 different heterozygous mutations in copper/zinc superoxide dismutase (SOD1) have been discovered in patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), a fatal neurodegenerative disease. Uniquely, D90A-SOD1 was identified in recessive, dominant, and apparently sporadic pedigrees. The phenotype of homozygotes is stereotyped with prolonged survival, whereas that of affected heterozygotes varies. The frequency of D90A-SOD1 is 50 times higher in Scandinavia (2.5%) than elsewhere, although the prevalence of ALS is not high there. Our previous study indicated distinct founders for recessive and dominant/sporadic ALS and we proposed a disease-modifying factor linked to the recessive mutation. Here, we doubled our sample set and used new markers to characterize the origin of the mutation and locate any modifying factors. Linkage disequilibrium analysis indicates that D90A homozygotes and heterozygotes share a rare haplotype and are all descended from a single ancient founder (alpha 0.974) approximately 895 generations ago. Homozygotes subsequently appeared only about 63 generations ago (alpha 0.878). Recombination reduced the region shared by the recessive parents to 97-265 kb around SOD1, excluding all neighboring genes. We propose that a cis-acting regulatory polymorphism appeared close to D90A-SOD1 in the recessive founder, which decreases susceptibility to ALS in heterozygotes and slows disease progression.\n",
      "A large proportion of autosomal recessive non-syndromic deafness (NSARD) in many populations is caused by variants of the GJB2 gene. Here, the frequency of GJB2 variants was investigated in 406 and 183 apparently unrelated children from Kenya and Sudan, respectively, with predominantly severe to profound non-syndromic hearing loss. Nine (2.2%) Kenyan and 12 (6.6%) Sudanese children carried variants within the coding sequence of the GJB2 gene. Variants in the 5'-flanking region were detected in an additional 115 individuals. In total, 10 new variants were recognized, including four variants in the 5' adjacent region of exon 2 encoding GJB2 (g.3318-6T>A, g.3318-15C>T, g.3318-34C >T). , g.3318-35T>G), a deletion of 6 base pairs (g.3455_3460del [p.Asp46_Gln48delinsGlu]), a variant leading to a stop codon (g.3512C>A [p.Tyr65X]), synonymous variants (g.3395C>T [p.Thr26], g.3503C>T [p.Asn62], g.3627A>C [p.Arg104]), and a non-synonymous variant (g.3816C>A [p.Val167Met ]). Additionally, the previously described variants g.3352delG (commonly referred to as 30delG or 35 delG), g.3426G>A [p.Val37Ile], g.3697G>A [p.Arg127His], g.3774G>A [p.Val153Ile ] and g.3795G>A [p.Gly160Ser] were identified. With the exception of g.3318-34C>T and g.3352delG, all variants arose heterozygously. For most variants identified in the study population in Kenya and Sudan, a causal association with NSARD appears unlikely. Compared to many other ethnic groups, GJB2 coding region variants associated with deafness are rare in Sudan and Kenya, suggesting the role of other genetic or epigenetic factors as a cause of deafness in these countries.\n",
      "Fragile X syndrome is one of the most common causes of mental retardation in men, and patients with fragile X syndrome sometimes develop autism. It is usually caused by an expansion of the trinucleotide repeat in the 5' untranslated region of the FMR1 gene, but in a small number of patients, deletions and point mutations have been identified. We screened all 17 exons of the FMR1 gene for mutations in 90 autistic or mentally retarded children using single-strand conformational polymorphism (SSCP) analysis by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). No mutations were found in 76 male patients. However, one patient was heterozygous for one normal allele and one mutant allele with an A to C substitution at nucleotide 879 in exon 9. This mutation was not found in the 50 controls. Reverse transcription-PCR revealed that a large proportion of the mutant transcripts were aberrantly spliced, causing premature termination of protein synthesis. Although rare, point mutations in the FMR1 gene may be a cause of autism and mental retardation in Japanese patients.\n",
      "BACKGROUND: Long-term anti-cytomegalovirus (CMV) treatments in immunocompromised patients are hampered by resistance to antiviral drugs. Longitudinal changes in resistance genotype may depend on changes in selective pressure and complexity of CMV isolates. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate longitudinal changes in CMV resistance genotype and phenotype as well as strain-specific variability in a patient with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma in whom successive anti-CMV treatments have failed. STUDY DESIGN:The resistance phenotype and genotype of seven CMV isolates collected from one patient during a 2-year follow-up period were retrospectively analyzed. In parallel, we used glycoprotein B (gB) genotyping and a and UL10-13 sequence analysis to study CMV interstrain variability. RESULTS: The patient was infected with at least three strains of CMV as well as variants of the parental strains. Resistance to ganciclovir, cidofovir and foscarnet were successively detected during the follow-up period. Changes in the UL97 protein kinase responsible for resistance to ganciclovir were initially detected at residues 591 and 592, and then at position 594. The decrease in sensitivity to foscarnet coincided with the appearance of the N495K amino acid substitution in DNA polymerase, while cross-resistance to ganciclovir and cidofovir was due to the L501I substitution. CONCLUSIONS: The CMV isolates obtained from our patient were complex mixtures of strains. Changes in resistance genotypes depended on resistance selective pressure and were not related to interstrain variation.\n",
      "Nijmegen breakage syndrome is a rare autosomal recessive chromosomal instability disorder characterized by early growth retardation, congenital microcephaly, immunodeficiency, borderline mental development, and a strong tendency toward lymphoreticular malignancies. Most patients with Nijmegen rupture syndrome are of Slavic origin and all known so far carry a homozygous founder deletion of 5 nucleotides in the NBS1 gene. Microcephaly was present in 100% of patients with Nijmegen rupture syndrome in a recent large international cooperative study. The frequency of Nijmegen rupture syndrome in children with primary microcephaly was not known. Correct and early diagnosis of the syndrome is crucial for appropriate preventive care and therapy. We tested 67 Czech patients of different ages with simple microcephaly for the presence of the most common mutation in the NBS1 gene. Three new cases of Nijmegen breakage syndrome were detected in this cohort, representing 4.5% of the cohort. All of these newly diagnosed Nijmegen rupture syndrome patients were younger than 10 months at the time of diagnosis. They were all born within a 2.5 year period. Twenty-three of the 67 children in the cohort were born during this 2.5-year period, representing a 13% incidence of Nijmegen rupture syndrome. The frequency of Nijmegen rupture syndrome heterozygotes in infants in the Czech Republic is 1: 130-158, and the birth rate is 90,000 per year. Therefore, within 2.5 years, three new Nijmegen rupture syndrome homozygotes are expected to be born. Therefore, we assume that through DNA testing of Czech primary microcephalic children it is possible to detect all expected patients of Nijmegen rupture syndrome. The age at correct diagnosis has been lowered from 7.1 years before DNA testing to well under a year. All new patients with Nijmegen breakage syndrome could benefit from tailored preventive care, which should significantly improve their life expectancy and prognosis.\n",
      "The authors describe the unusual association between diffuse gastric B-cell lymphoma and myotonic dystrophy, the most common form of adult muscular dystrophy, and sudden atrial fibrillation after a cycle of doxorubicin-based chemotherapy in the same patient. patient. Atrial fibrillation or other cardiac arrhythmias are unusual complications in patients treated with chemotherapy. The cardiac toxicity intrinsically associated with the aggressive chemotherapy used could function as a triggering factor for the arrhythmia in the predisposed myocardium of this patient.\n",
      "The aim of this study was to perform an analysis of the 5-alpha-reductase type 2 (SRD5A2) gene in a male pseudohermaphrodite (MPH) patient with normal testosterone (T) production and coding sequences for the gene. of the normal androgen receptor (AR). A patient of Chinese origin with ambiguous genitalia at 14 months, 46,XY karyotype and normal T secretion under human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) stimulation underwent gonadectomy at 20 months. Exons 1 to 8 of the AR gene and exons 1 to 5 of the SRD5A2 gene were sequenced from peripheral blood DNA. The AR gene coding sequences were normal. Analysis of the SRD5A2 gene revealed 2 consecutive mutations in exon 4, each located in a different allele: 1) a deletion of the T nucleotide, which predicts a frameshift mutation at codon 219, and 2) a missense mutation at codon 227, where substitution of guanine (CGA) by adenine (CAA) predicts replacement of arginine (R227Q) by glutamine. The testes located in the inguinal canal presented a normal morphology for age. The patient was a compound heterozygote for SRD5A2 mutations, carrying 2 mutations in exon 4. The patient had an R227Q mutation that has been described in an Asian population and MPH patients, as well as a novel frameshift mutation , Tdel219. Testis morphology showed that during infancy, 5-alpha-reductase enzyme deficiency may not have affected interstitial or tubular development.\n",
      "BACKGROUND: Gitelman syndrome (GS) is an autosomal recessive disorder resulting from inactivating mutations in the thiazide-sensitive Na-Cl co-transporter (NCCT) gene. To date, nearly 90 mutations have been identified. It is possible that there is a population-specific distribution of mutations. In this study, we analyzed the NCCT gene mutations of seven Japanese patients with GS. METHODS:Peripheral blood mononuclear cells were isolated from GS patients, their family members, and healthy control subjects. Mutation analysis of the NCCT gene was performed entirely by direct automated sequencing of polymerase chain reaction-amplified DNA products. In patients with splice site deletion or mutation, we undertook cDNA sequence analysis. RESULTS: We identified nine mutations. Five of them [c.185C>T (Thr60Met), c.1712C>T (Ala569Val), c.1930C>T (Arg642Cys), c.2552T>A (Leu849His) and c.1932delC] have been reported in Japanese patients. , but not in GS patients from other ethnic groups. The remaining four mutations [c.7A>T (Met1Leu), c.1181_1186+20del26, c.1811_1812delAT and IVS16+1G>A] were novel. In cDNA derived from a patient with c.1181_1186+20del26, a deletion of exon 9 and a frameshift at the beginning of exon 10 were observed. In cDNA derived from patients with IVS16+1G>A, an additional 96 bp insertion between exons 16 and 17 was observed. Six out of seven patients were compound heterozygotes, and the remainder carried a single heterozygous mutation. CONCLUSIONS: We found four novel mutations in the NCCT gene in seven Japanese patients with GS. Furthermore, our study suggests that the distribution of NCCT gene mutations in Japanese GS patients potentially differs from that in other populations.\n",
      "To study molecular defects in two Chinese pedigrees with hereditary factor V (FV) deficiency. A 37-year-old man (proband 1) and an 18-month-old boy (proband 2) were diagnosed with hereditary FV coagulation deficiency due to severe reduction in plasma FV activity and antigen levels. . The 25 exons and their flanking sequence of the F5 gene were amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for both candidates and the PCR products were directly sequenced. Total RNA was extracted from peripheral lymphocytes of proband 1 to detect changes at the mRNA level. The homozygous IVS8 -2A>G deletion was identified in the F5 gene of proband 1 and complementary DNA (cDNA) analysis revealed the abolition of the canonical splice site by mutation and activation of the site cryptic acceptor 24 bp upstream. The insertion introduced eight additional amino acids (AAs) into the FV protein. Two heterozygous mutations in the F5 gene were discovered in proband 2. AG 2238-9del in exon 13 introduced a premature termination code at 689 AA and substitution of G6410 with T in exon 23 led to the missense mutation Gly2079Val. Three F5 gene mutations, IVS8 -2A>G, 2238-9del AG and G6410T, were identified in two Chinese pedigrees with congenital FV deficiency, respectively.\n",
      "OBJECTIVE: To identify the genetic anomaly leading to congenital nuclear cataract affecting a large Swiss family of five generations. METHODS: Family history and clinical data were recorded. The phenotype was documented by both slit lamp and Scheimpflug photography. A cortical lens was evaluated by electron microscopy after cataract extraction. Lenticular phenotyping and genotyping were performed independently with short tandem repeat polymorphism. Linkage analysis was performed and candidate genes were amplified by PCR and screened for mutations on both strands by direct sequencing. RESULTS: Affected individuals had congenital lactescent nuclear cataract in both eyes. Linkage was observed on chromosome 17 for the DNA marker D17S1857 (ld score: 3.44 at theta = 0). Direct sequencing of CRYBA3/A1, which matches the neighborhood, revealed a 3 bp in-frame deletion of exon 4 (279delGAG). This mutation involved a deletion of glycine-91, segregated in all affected individuals, and was not observed in unaffected individuals or in 250 normal control subjects of the same ethnic origin. Electron microscopy showed that the morphology of the cortical lens fibers was normal. CONCLUSIONS: DeltaG91 mutation in CRYBA3/A1 is associated with autosomal dominant congenital nuclear lactescent cataract. A splice mutation (IVS3+1G/A) of this gene has been reported in zonular cataract with sutural opacities. These results indicate phenotypic heterogeneity linked to mutations in this gene.\n",
      "Alpers syndrome is a fatal neurogenetic disorder first described more than 70 years ago. It is an autosomal recessive developmental disorder of mitochondrial DNA depletion characterized by deficiency of mitochondrial DNA polymerase gamma (POLG) catalytic activity, refractory seizures, neurodegeneration, and liver disease. In two unrelated Alpers syndrome pedigrees, each affected child was found to carry a homozygous mutation in exon 17 of the POLG locus that led to a Glu873Stop mutation just upstream of the polymerase domain of the protein. Additionally, each affected child was heterozygous for the G1681A mutation in exon 7 which led to an Ala467Thr substitution in POLG, in the protein binding region.\n",
      "OBJECTIVE: To evaluate and characterize the risk of bladder cancer and its relationship with cyclophosphamide in patients with Wegener's granulomatosis. METHODS: From the Swedish National Inpatient Registry, a cohort of 1065 patients with Wegener's granulomatosis, 1969-95, was identified. Through linkage with the Swedish Cancer Registry, all subjects in this cohort diagnosed with bladder cancer were identified. Nested within the cohort, a matched case-control study was performed to estimate the association between cyclophosphamide and bladder cancer using odds ratios (OR) as relative risk. In the cohort, the cumulative risk of bladder cancer after Wegener's granulomatosis and the relative prevalence of a history of bladder cancer at the time of Wegener's granulomatosis diagnosis were also estimated. RESULTS: The median cumulative doses of cyclophosphamide among cases (n = 11) and controls (n = 25) were 113 g and 25 g, respectively. The risk of bladder cancer doubled for each 10 g increase in cyclophosphamide (OR = 2.0, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.8 to 4.9). Treatment duration greater than 1 year was associated with an eight-fold increased risk (OR = 7.7, 95% CI 0.9 to 69). The absolute risk of bladder cancer in the cohort reached 10% 16 years after Wegener's granulomatosis diagnosis, and a history of bladder cancer was (nonsignificantly) twice as common as expected at the time of diagnosis. diagnosis of Wegener's granulomatosis. CONCLUSION: Results indicate a dose-response relationship between cyclophosphamide and bladder cancer risk, high cumulative risks in the entire cohort, as well as the possibility that risk factors operate even before Wegener's granulomatosis .\n",
      "DiGeorge and velocardiofacial syndromes (DGS/VCFS) have a similar complex phenotype including cardiovascular, craniofacial and thymic malformations, and are associated with heterozygous deletions of chromosome band 22q11. The commonly deleted region of the 22q11.21 subband (here called TDR22) is very gene dense and the extent of deletion has been precisely defined in several studies. However, to date there is no evidence of a haploinsufficiency mechanism that can fully explain the DGS/VCFS phenotype. In this study, we show that the mapping of the candidate gene HIRA/Tuple1 to undeleted TDR22, in DGS/VCFS subjects, exhibits delayed replication timing. Furthermore, we observed an increase in the cell ratio showing the HIRA/Tuple1 locus localized towards the nuclear periphery. Replication timing and nuclear localization are known to generally correlate with the transcriptional activity of the relative DNA region. We propose that the altered replication/nuclear localization pattern of unsuppressed TDR22 indicates altered gene regulation, hence altered transcription in DGS/VCFS.\n",
      "Microfluorimetry and patch-clamp experiments were performed on HEK cells expressing TRPV6 to determine whether this Ca(2+)-sensing channel is constitutively active. Intact cells loaded with fura-2 had a high intracellular concentration of free Ca(2+) ((i)), which decreased to the same level as in untransfected cells if external Ca(2+) was chelated by the EGTA. Whole-cell recordings from untransfected HEK cells and cells expressing human TRPV6 revealed the presence of an inward basal current in both cell types when the internal solution contained 0.1 m m EGTA and 100 n m ( i) or if cytosolic Ca(2+) buffering is not disrupted in perforated patch-clamp experiments. If recombinantly expressed TRPV6 forms open channels, current Ca(2+)-mediated inhibition would be expected, as TRPV6 is negatively regulated by internal Ca(2+). However, dialysis of solutions with high concentration such as 1 microm in TRPV6-expressing cells did not block the inward basal current, which was no different from recordings from untransfected cells. In contrast, dialysis of 0.5 m m EGTA into TRPV6-expressing cells readily activated inward Ca(2+) currents, which were undetectable in untransfected cells. Interestingly, monovalent cations permeated TRPV6 channels under conditions where no Ca(2+) permeation was detectable, indicating that divalent cations block TRPV6 channels from the extracellular side. Like human TRPV6, truncated human TRPV6 (Delta695-725), lacking the C-terminal domain required for Ca(2+)-calmodulin binding, does not form constitutive active channels, whereas human TRPV6 (D542A) , carrying a point mutation in the presumed pore region, does not function as a channel. In summary, no constitutive open TRPV6 channels were detected in patch-clamp experiments from transfected HEK cells. However, channel activity is strongly regulated by intracellular and extracellular divalent cations.\n",
      "Resistance to thyroid hormone syndrome (RTH) is a rare disease, generally transmitted in an autosomal dominant manner. Patients with RTH are usually euthyroid but may occasionally present with signs and symptoms of thyrotoxicosis or rarely hypothyroidism. Affected individuals are usually heterozygous for mutations in the thyroid hormone receptor beta (TR-beta) gene. We present a patient with RTH homo-/hemizygous for a mutation in the TR-beta gene. The single nucleotide substitution I280S (1123T-->G) was present either on both alleles or in a hemizygous form with complete deletion of the second allele. The I280S mutation was recently reported in a heterozygous patient. The severe phenotype with severely impaired intellectual development, hyperkinetic behavior, tachycardia, hearing and visual impairment is likely due to the dominant negative effect of the mutant I280S protein and the absence of any functional TR-beta.\n",
      "Endothelin-1 (ET-1) is a potent vasoconstrictor and exhibits diverse pharmacological responses. Two single nucleotide polymorphisms in the ET-1 (EDN1) gene have been reported to be associated with blood pressure (BP). One of them is the Lys198Asn polymorphism, which showed a positive association with blood pressure in overweight people. Another is the 3A/4A (-134delA) polymorphism located in the 5' untranslated region. In this study, we investigated the expression of the Lys198Asn polymorphism in ET-1 in vitro, as well as the association between either of the two polymorphisms and plasma ET-1 level. We expressed both major (Lys-type) and minor (Asn-type) preproET-1 in three different cell lines, and measured the levels of ET-1 and big ET-1 in the culture supernatant. There was no significant difference in the levels of ET-1 or big ET-1 between the Asn-type and Lys-type transfectant. In the combination study, plasma ET-1 levels in 54 hypertensive patients with an amino acid substitution of Lys for Asn at position 198 were not different from those in hypertensives without the substitution. However, we found a significant difference in ET-1 levels between individuals carrying the 3A/3A and 3A/4A genotypes. Our transient expression study indicates that the Lys198Asn polymorphism may not directly affect ET-1 and significant ET-1 production. Another variant of the EDN1 gene in linkage disequilibrium with the Lys198Asn polymorphism may be responsible for the association with BP, or the interaction between the EDN1 Lys198Asn polymorphism and other factors such as obesity may be involved in the mechanisms increasing BP in vivo.\n",
      "BACKGROUND: Primary vesicoureteral reflux (VUR) is an inherited disorder characterized by retrograde flow of urine through the ureters and kidneys. It affects around 1% of young children and is therefore one of the most common hereditary diseases. The associated nephropathy is an important cause of end-stage renal failure in children and adults. Recent studies indicate that genetic ablation of the mouse uroplakin (UP) III gene, which encodes a 47 kD urothelial-specific integral membrane protein forming urothelial plaques, causes VUR and hydronephrosis. METHODS: To begin to determine whether mutations in the UP genes might play a role in human VUR, we genotyped the four UP genes in 76 patients with radiologically proven primary VUR by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification and sequencing of all their exons plus 50 to 150 bp of flanking intronic sequences. RESULTS: Eighteen single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were identified, seven of which were missense, without truncation or frameshift mutations. Because healthy relatives of VUR probands are not reliable negative controls for VUR, we used a population of 90 healthy, race-matched individuals, unrelated to VUR patients, as controls to perform a study of VUR. 'association. Most SNPs were not found to be significantly associated with VUR. However, SNP1 of the UP Ia gene affecting a C to T conversion and an Ala7Val change, and SNP7 of UP III affecting a C to G conversion and a Pro154Ala change, were marginally associated with VUR (both P = 0.08). Additional case studies yielded a second set of data that, in combination with the first set, confirmed a weak association of UP III SNP7 in VUR (adjusted P = 0.036 for both subsets of cases versus controls ). CONCLUSION: Such a weak association and the absence of families with simple dominant Mendelian inheritance suggest that missense changes in uroplakin genes may not play a dominant role in the occurrence of VUR in humans, although that they may constitute weak risk factors contributing to a complex polygenic disease. The fact that no truncation or frameshift mutations were found in any of the VUR patients, coupled with our recent discovery that some breeding pairs of UP III knockout mice yield litters that not only exhibit VUR , but also severe hydronephrosis and neonatal death, raises the possibility that major mutations in uroplakin could be embryonic or postnatal lethal in humans.\n",
      "Crataegus tincture (TCR), an alcoholic extract of hawthorn berries (Crataegus oxycantha), is used in herbal medicine and homeopathy. The present study was carried out to investigate the protective effect of TCR on experimentally induced myocardial infarction in rats. TCR pretreatment, at a dose of 0.5 mL/100 g body weight per day, orally for 30 days, prevented the increase in lipid peroxidation and marker enzyme activity observed in rats induced by isoproterenol (85 mg kg(-1) s.c. for 2 days at 24 hour intervals). TCR prevented the isoproterenol-induced decrease in antioxidant enzymes in the heart and increased the ADP-stimulated oxygen uptake rate and respiratory coupling ratio. TCR protected against isoproterenol-induced pathological changes in the rat heart. The results show that pretreatment with TCR may be useful in preventing isoproterenol-induced damage in the rat heart.\n",
      "The antioxidant enzyme paraoxonase 1 (PON1) has previously been suggested to confer protection against coronary heart disease (CHD), one of the leading causes of death in the Western world. Two coding polymorphisms, 55M/L and 192Q/R, as well as a promoter variant, -107C/T, have been studied extensively with respect to susceptibility to coronary heart disease. In this study, we investigated the impact of these three polymorphisms on mortality using a sample of 1,932 Danish individuals aged 47–93 years, previously used in studies of genetic longevity. A cross-sectional study comparing the genotype distribution of the three polymorphisms separately as well as the haplotype distribution in different age groups revealed no differences. However, a follow-up longitudinal survival study in the same sample indicated that 192RR homozygotes have poorer survival than QQ homozygotes (hazard ratio: 1.38, P = 0.04). We then used an independent sample of 541 Danish individuals from the oldest cohort and confirmed the initial results (hazard ratio: 1.38, P = 0.09). In both samples, the effect was more pronounced among women. Using self-reported ischemic heart disease data to assess the impact of the PON 192Q/R polymorphism on coronary heart disease susceptibility, we found only a non-significant trend that 192RR homozygosity in women was a factor. of risk. Our results thus indicate that PON1 192RR homozygosity is associated with increased mortality in women in the second half of life and that this increased mortality is perhaps linked to the severity of coronary heart disease and survival after illness. coronary heart disease rather than susceptibility to the development of coronary heart disease.\n",
      "There is concern that the risk of cardiovascular thrombotic events may be higher with specific cyclooxygenase (COX)-2 inhibitors than with nonselective nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). We evaluated data on cardiovascular events related to valdecoxib, a novel specific COX-2 inhibitor, in approximately 8,000 patients with osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis treated with this agent in randomized clinical trials. The incidence of cardiovascular thrombotic events (cardiac, cerebrovascular and peripheral vascular or arterial thrombotic events) was determined by analyzing a pool of valdecoxib (10 to 80 mg daily), non-selective NSAIDs (diclofenac 75 mg bid, ibuprofen 800 mg tid or naproxen 500 mg bid ) and placebo data from 10 randomized trials in osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis of 6 to 52 weeks duration. Incidence rates of events were determined in all patients (n = 7,934) and in low-dose aspirin users (< or = 325 mg daily) (n = 1,051) and in non- aspirin users (n = 6,883). Crude and exposure-adjusted incidences of thrombotic events were similar for valdecoxib, NSAIDs, and placebo. The risk of serious thrombotic events was also similar for each dose of valdecoxib. Thrombotic risk was consistently higher among aspirin users than among non-aspirin users (placebo, 1.4% versus 0%; valdecoxib, 1.7% versus 0.2%; NSAIDs, 1.9 % versus 0.5%). Event rates among aspirin users were similar for the 3 treatment groups and for all doses of valdecoxib. Short- and medium-term treatment with therapeutic (10 or 20 mg daily) and supratherapeutic (40 or 80 mg daily) doses of valdecoxib was not associated with an increased incidence of thrombotic events compared to NSAIDs. non-selective or placebo in patients suffering from osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis. controlled clinical trials.\n",
      "We previously reported an association of FCGR2B-Ile232Thr with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) in three Asian populations. Since polymorphism in CD72, another inhibitory B-cell receptor, was associated with murine SLE, we identified human CD72 polymorphisms, tested their association with SLE, and examined genetic interaction with FCGR2B in Japanese ( 160 LED, 277 witnesses), the Thais (87 LED). , 187 controls) and Caucasians (94 families containing SLE members). Four polymorphisms and six rare variations were detected. The first constituted two major haplotypes containing one or two repeats of 13 nucleotides in intron 8 (designated *1 and *2, respectively). Although no association with SLE susceptibility was detected, the *1 allele was significantly associated with nephritis in Japanese patients (P = 0.024). RT-PCR identified a novel alternatively spliced ​​(AS) transcript expressed at the protein level in COS-7 transfectants. The AS/common isoform ratio was significantly increased in individuals with *2/*2 genotype compared to *1/*1 (P=0.000038) or *1/*2 (P=0.0085) genotypes. Using the two Asian cohorts, a significant association of FCGR2B-232Thr/Thr with SLE was observed only in the presence of the CD72-*1/*1 genotype (OR 4.63, 95% CI 1.47-14, 6, P=0.009 versus FCGR2B-232Ile/Ile plus CD72-*2/*2). Minigene analyzes demonstrated that the repetition of 13 nucleotides and the deletion of 4 bp within the same haplotype of intron 8 could regulate alternative splicing. The AS isoform lacks exon 8 and is inferred to contain 49 amino acid changes in the membrane-distal portion of the extracellular domain, where considerable amino acid changes are known in the associated CD72(c) allele to murine LED. These results indicated that the presence of the CD72-*2 allele decreases the risk of human SLE conferred by FCGR2B-232Thr, possibly by increasing the AS isoform of CD72.\n",
      "Disseminated superficial actinic porokeratosis (DSAP) is a rare autosomal dominant chronic keratinization disorder characterized by multiple superficial keratotic lesions surrounded by a slightly raised keratotic border. So far, although two DSAP loci have been identified, the genetic basis and pathogenesis of this disorder have not yet been elucidated. In this study, we performed genome-wide linkage analysis in three affected Chinese families and located the gene within an 8.0 cM interval defined by D12S330 and D12S354 on chromosome 12. When screening 30 genes candidates, we identified a missense mutation, p.Ser63Asn. in SSH1 in one family, a frameshift mutation, p.Ser19CysfsX24 in an alternative variant (isoform f) of SSH1 in another family and a frameshift mutation, p.Pro27ProfsX54 in the same alternative variant in a case unfamiliar with DSAP. SSH1 encodes a phosphatase that plays a central role in actin dynamics. Our data suggest that cytoskeletal disorganization in epidermal cells is likely associated with the pathogenesis of DSAP.\n",
      "BACKGROUND: A dengue type 2 virus (DEN-2 Tonga/74) isolated from a 1974 outbreak was characterized by mild disease and belongs to the American genotype of DEN-2 viruses. To prepare a vaccine candidate, a previously described 30-nucleotide deletion (Delta30) in the 3' untranslated region of DEN-4 was modified in isolate DEN-2. METHODS:A full-length cDNA clone was generated from DEN-2 virus and used to produce recombinant DEN-2 (rDEN-2) and rDEN2Delta30. Virus replication was assessed in SCID mice transplanted with human hepatoma cells (SCID-HuH-7 mice), in mosquitoes, and in rhesus monkeys. Induction of neutralizing antibodies and protective efficacy were also evaluated in rhesus monkeys. RESULTS: Replication of rDEN2Delta30 virus was reduced tenfold in SCID-HuH-7 mice compared to the parent virus. The rDEN-2 viruses were not infectious to Aedes mosquitoes, but both Toxorynchites mosquitoes were easily infected. In rhesus monkeys, rDEN2Delta30 appeared to be slightly attenuated compared to the parent virus, as measured by the duration and peak of viremia and induction of neutralizing antibodies. A derivative of rDEN2Delta30, named rDEN2Delta30-4995, was generated by incorporation of a previously identified point mutation in the NS3 gene of DEN-4 and was found to be more attenuated than rDEN2Delta30 in SCID-HuH-7 mice. CONCLUSIONS: The rDEN2Delta30 and rDEN2Delta30-4995 viruses may be considered for evaluation in humans and for inclusion in a tetravalent dengue vaccine.\n",
      "BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES: Interleukin-12 (IL-12) governs the Th1-type immune response, affecting spontaneous and treatment-induced recovery after HCV infection. We investigated whether IL12B polymorphisms in the promoter region (4 bp insertion/deletion) and the 3'-UTR (1188-A/C), which are thought to influence IL-12 synthesis, were associated following HCV infection. . METHODS: We analyzed 186 individuals with spontaneous HCV clearance, 501 patients chronically infected with HCV, and 217 healthy controls. Genotyping of IL12B 3'-UTR and promoter was performed by Taqman-based assays with allele-specific oligonucleotide probes and allele-specific DNA amplification by PCR, respectively. RESULTS: The proportion of IL12B promoter and 3'-UTR genotypes did not differ significantly between the different cohorts. However, HCV genotype 1-infected patients with high baseline viremia and carrying the IL12B 3'-UTR 1188-C allele had significantly higher sustained virologic response (SVR) rates (25.3% compared to 46% versus 54.5% for A/A, A/C, and C/C) due to reduced relapse rates (24.2% versus 12% versus zero% for A/A, A/C, and C/C). CONCLUSIONS: Carriers of the IL12B 3'-UTR 1188-C allele appear to be able to respond more effectively to combination antiviral therapy due to a reduced relapse rate. No association between IL12B polymorphisms and self-limited HCV infection could be demonstrated.\n",
      "OBJECTIVE: Congenital long QT syndrome (LQTS) with in utero onset of rhythm disturbances is associated with a poor prognosis. In this study, we investigated a neonate with fetal bradycardia, 2:1 atrioventricular block, and ventricular tachycardia shortly after birth. METHODS: Mutational analysis and DNA sequencing were performed in a neonate. 2:1 atrioventricular block improved to 1:1 conduction only after intravenous infusion of lidocaine or high dose mexiletine, which also controlled ventricular tachycardia. RESULTS: A novel spontaneous LQTS-3 mutation was identified in transmembrane segment 6 of domain IV of the cardiac Na(v)1.5 sodium channel, with a G-->A substitution at codon 1763, which altered a valine (GTG) to a methionine (ATG). The proband was heterozygous but the mutation was absent in the parents and sister. Expression of this mutant channel in tsA201 mammalian cells by site-directed mutagenesis revealed a persistent current sensitive to tetrodotoxin but resistant to lidocaine, associated with a positive shift in the steady-state inactivation curve, a steeper activation curve and faster recovery after inactivation. We also found a similar electrophysiological profile for the neighboring mutant V1764M. But the other neighboring I1762A mutant had no persistent current and was always associated with a positive inactivation shift. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that Na(v)1.5/V1763M channel dysfunction and possible neighboring mutants contribute to persistent inward current due to altered inactivation kinetics and clinically congenital LQTS with perinatal onset d arrhythmias responding to lidocaine and mexiletine.\n",
      "Beta-adrenergic receptors (beta-AR) are G protein-coupled receptors activated by epinephrine and norepinephrine and are involved in various physiological functions. Previously, three beta-AR genes (ADRB1, ADRB2, and ADRB3) were resequenced, identifying polymorphisms used in genetic association studies of cardiovascular and metabolic disorders. These studies produced intriguing but inconsistent results, likely because the known functional variants: ADRB1 Arg389Gly and Gly49Ser, ADRB2 Arg16Gly and Gln27Glu, and ADRB3 Arg64Trp provided an incomplete picture of the total functional diversity of these genes. Therefore, we created marker panels for each beta-AR gene including the known functional markers as well as other markers regularly spaced and with sufficient density to identify haplotype block structure and maximize haplotype diversity. A total of 27 markers were genotyped in 96 Caucasian Americans and 96 African Americans. In both populations and for each gene, a single block with little evidence of historical recombination was observed. For each gene, the haplotype captured most of the information content of each functional locus, even if that locus was not genotyped, and it is likely that the haplotype would capture signal from unknown functional loci whose alleles are d moderate abundance. This study demonstrates the utility of using beta-AR gene haplotype maps and marker panels as tools for linkage studies of beta-AR function.\n",
      "Despite the growing need to identify and quantify tissue oxygenation at the cellular level, relatively few methods are available. In this study, we developed a novel hypoxia-responsive reporter vector using a hypoxia-responsive element of the vascular endothelial growth factor 5' untranslated region and generated a novel hypoxia-sensing transgenic rat. We then applied this animal model to the detection of tubulointerstitial hypoxia in the diseased kidney. With this model, we were able to identify diffuse cortical hypoxia in puromycin aminonucleoside-induced nephrotic syndrome and focal and segmental hypoxia in the remnant kidney model. Expression of the hypoxia-responsive transgene increased throughout the observation period, reaching 2.2-fold at 2 weeks in the puromycin aminonucleoside model and 2.6-fold at 4 weeks in the remnant kidney model. , while that of vascular endothelial growth factor showed a slight decrease. reflecting distinct behaviors of the two genes. The degree of hypoxia showed a positive correlation with microscopic tubulointerstitial damage in both models. Finally, we identified the localization of nuclear proliferating antigen-positive, ED-1-positive, terminally tagged-positive cells with the dUTP terminus in the hypoxic cortical area of ​​the remnant kidney model. We propose here a possible pathological link between chronic tubulointerstitial hypoxia and progressive glomerular diseases.\n",
      "Breast cancer accounts for 30-40% of all cancer deaths among women. In an effort to identify tumor-associated antigens that could be useful for immunotherapy, we used the serological analysis of recombinant cDNA expression libraries (SEREX) technique to identify cancer-associated antigens. breast. SEREX screening of cDNA expression libraries derived from 3 breast cancer patients identified a total of 88 positive clones (bcg-1 to bcg-88), including 27 previously unknown sequences. The cDNA sequences and mRNA expression patterns were characterized. Seroreactivity of SEREX clones was determined in the sera of 75 breast cancer patients, 75 colon cancer patients and 25 healthy donors. Expression analysis on a panel of cDNAs from 17 different normal tissues by reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) revealed tissue-restricted mRNA expression of 2 of 27 unknown antigens. Bcg-72 is expressed only in the breast, prostate and thymus, while Bcg-84 is expressed at moderate levels in the testis, spleen and breast. The other 25 unknown antigens were expressed in most other tissues. Serological analysis revealed that 7 of 88 clones showed reactivity to at least one serum from 75 breast cancer patients or 75 colon cancer patients. These clones did not react with sera from a panel of 25 healthy adult individuals. Our results demonstrate the utility of the SEREX approach for the identification of potential tumor-associated antigens in human breast cancer.\n",
      "BACKGROUND: Recent data suggest that prostate-specific antigen (PSA) polymorphisms may increase the risk of prostate cancer (PC). The PSA gene contains a G/A substitution in region 1 of the androgen response element (ARE). The androgen receptor (AR) gene has polymorphic regions containing glutamine and glycine repeats of variable length and these are thought to be associated with CP risk. The effect on PC risks of PSA polymorphisms alone and in synergy with the AR gene was examined in this report. METHODS: One hundred CP patients and an age-matched cohort consisting of 79 benign prostatic hyperplasia patients and 67 population controls were included in this study. DNA was extracted from blood and the PSA/ARE promoter region amplified by PCR. PCR products were cut with the restriction enzyme Nhe 1 to distinguish G/A alleles. The length of AR/CAG and GGC repeats was detected by automated fluorescence from PCR products. RESULTS: We found a significantly higher PSA/GG distribution in PC (30%) than in benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) (18%) or control population (16%) (P = 0.025) . Furthermore, the distribution of GG within cases was even greater in younger men (<65 years; 42%; P = 0.012). Additionally, when PSA genotype was cross-classified with CAG repeat, significantly more cases than BPH and control population with short (<22) CAG/GG genotype were observed (P = 0.006). CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate that the PSA/ARE GG genotype confers an increased risk of CP, particularly in younger men. Furthermore, we confirm previous results that short glutamine repeat in conjunction with GG genotype significantly increases the risk of malignant disease.\n",
      "A 14-year-old girl suffers from recurrent acute interstitial nephritis, induced by azithromycin. The second episode was more serious than the first; and although both were treated with intensive corticosteroid therapy, renal function remained impaired. Although most cases of antibiotic-induced acute interstitial nephritis are mild and self-limiting, some patients are at risk of permanent kidney damage.\n",
      "Bernard-Soulier syndrome (BSS) is a rare hereditary bleeding disorder caused by quantitative or qualitative abnormalities of the platelet glycoprotein (GP) Ib/IX/V complex, the main receptor for von Willebrand factor. The complex includes four subunits, each encoded by a distinct gene. Several mutations have been described for each of the subunits, except GPV, as a cause of BSS. Here we describe the genetic basis of the disorder in a child with BSS. Flow cytometric analysis of the patient's platelets showed markedly reduced surface expression of all three glycoproteins of the GPIb/IX/V complex. DNA sequencing analysis showed that the patient was a compound heterozygote for two mutations in the GPIX gene, a novel nine-nucleotide deletion beginning at position 1952 of the gene that changes asparagine 86 to alanine and removes acids amino acids 87, 88, and 89 (arginine, threonine, and proline) and a previously reported point mutation that changes the asparagine codon (AAC) to serine (AGC) at residue 45. His mother was heterozygous for the Asn45Ser mutation, and his father, for the deletion of nine nucleotides. Our results suggest that the additive effects of the two GPIX gene mutations are responsible for the patient's BSS phenotype.\n",
      "BACKGROUND: Although the incidence of new-onset diabetes mellitus may increase in patients with schizophrenia treated with certain atypical antipsychotic agents, it remains unclear whether atypical agents directly affect glucose metabolism or simply increase glucose metabolism. known risk factors for diabetes. OBJECTIVE: To study the 2 drugs most clearly involved (clozapine and olanzapine) and risperidone using a frequently sampled intravenous glucose tolerance test. DESIGN: A cross-sectional design in stable, treated patients with schizophrenia, assessed using a frequently sampled intravenous glucose tolerance test and Bergman minimal model analysis. SETTING: Subjects were recruited from an urban community mental health clinic and were studied at a general clinical research center. Patients Fifty subjects signed informed consent and 41 underwent the frequently sampled intravenous glucose tolerance test. Thirty-six non-obese subjects with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder, matched for body mass index and treated with either clozapine, olanzapine or risperidone, were included in the analysis. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Fasting plasma glucose and fasting serum insulin levels, insulin sensitivity index, homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance, and glucose efficiency. RESULTS: The mean +/- SD duration of treatment with the identified atypical antipsychotic agent was 68.3 +/- 28.9 months (clozapine), 29.5 +/- 17.5 months (olanzapine), and 40. 9 +/- 33.7 (risperidone). Fasting serum insulin concentrations differed between groups (F(33) = 3.35; P = 0.047) (clozapine > olanzapine > risperidone) with significant differences between clozapine and risperidone (t(33) = 2 .32; P = 0.03) and olanzapine and risperidone (t (33) = 2.15; P = 0.04). There was a significant difference in insulin sensitivity index between groups (F(33) = 10.66; P < 0.001) (clozapine < olanzapine < risperidone), subjects who received clozapine and olanzapine showing significant insulin resistance compared to risperidone-treated subjects (clozapine vs risperidone, t(33) = -4.29; P < 0.001; olanzapine vs risperidone, t(33) = -3.62 ; P = 0.001 [P<0.001]). Homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance also differed significantly between groups (F(33) = 4.92; P = 0.01) (clozapine > olanzapine > risperidone) (clozapine vs risperidone , t(33) = 2.94; P = 0.006; olanzapine vs. risperidone, t(33) = 2.42; There was a significant difference between groups in glucose efficacy (F(30) = 4.18; P = 0.02) (clozapine < olanzapine < risperidone) with significant differences between clozapine and risperidone ( t (30) = -2.59; P = 0.02). ) and olanzapine and risperidone (t(30) = -2.34, P = 0.03). CONCLUSIONS: Non-obese groups treated with clozapine and olanzapine showed significant insulin resistance and decreased glucose efficiency compared to subjects treated with risperidone. Patients taking clozapine and olanzapine should be evaluated for insulin resistance and its consequences.\n",
      "Ten primary central nervous system lymphomas (PCNSL, cerebral lymphomas) were screened for deletion, mutation and methylation of exon 1beta of the p14 gene by Southern blot analysis, nucleotide chain reaction clone analysis by polymerase and Southern blot methylation assay. In Southern blot analysis, based on the signal densities of the hybridized bands and their similarities to those of exons 2 and 3 in our previous quantitative study, we found that exon 1beta was homozygously deleted in four cases, hemizygously deleted in five cases and not deleted in one case. Thus, the same deletion patterns covered the entire p14 gene in all but one case, which suggested hemizygous deletion of exons 1beta and 2 and homozygous deletion of exon 3. Additionally, although exon 1beta mutation is rare in various tumors, we detected a missense mutation (L50R) in one case with a deletion hemizygous. Methylation of the 5'CpG island of the p14 gene has in no case been suggested without homozygous deletion. Our observation of frequent p14 gene abnormalities (90%) and inactivation (40-60%) contrasted strikingly with the same pathological subtype of systemic lymphoma in which p14 gene abnormalities and inactivation were minimal. frequent, suggesting a difference in carcinogenesis between PCNSL and systemic. lymphoma.\n",
      "The HH genotype of the non-conservative amino acid substitution polymorphism N372H in the BRCA2 gene was reported to be associated with a 1.3- to 1.5-fold increase in breast and ovarian cancer risk. These studies focused on sporadic cancer cases, we examined whether N372H and another common variant located in the 5' untranslated region (203G > A) of the BRCA2 gene modified the risk of breast or ovarian cancer in carriers of the BRCA1 mutation. The study included 778 women carrying a germline BRCA1 mutation belonging to 403 families. The two BRCA2 variants were analyzed by the TaqMan allelic discrimination technique. Genotypes were analyzed by disease-free survival analysis using a Cox proportional hazards model. We found no evidence of a significant change in breast cancer penetrance in BRCA1 mutation carriers by either polymorphism. Regarding the risk of ovarian cancer, we also saw no effect with the N372H variant, but we observed a borderline association with the 203A allele of the 5' untranslated region (risk ratio, 1.43; CI, 1.01-2.00). Contrary to the results of Healey et al. on neonatal females and control adult females, we found no deviation from Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium in the distribution of N372H alleles for our BRCA1-carrying females. We conclude that if these single nucleotide polymorphisms do modify cancer risk in BRCA1 mutation carriers, their effects are not significantly greater than those of N372H previously observed in the general population.\n",
      "We investigated the relationship between spinal motor neuron degeneration and N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) receptor activation following neuraxial morphine following a non-injurious interval of aortic occlusion in rats. Spinal cord ischemia was induced by aortic occlusion for 6 minutes with a balloon catheter. In a microdialysis study, 10 µL of saline (group C; n = 8) or 30 mug of morphine (group M; n = 8) were injected intrathecally (IT) 0.5 h after reflow, and 30 mug of morphine (SM group; n = 8) or 10 µL of saline (SC group; n = 8) were injected IT 0.5 h after the sham operation. Microdialysis samples were collected before ischemia, before IT injection, and at 2, 4, 8, 24, and 48 h of reperfusion (after IT injection). Second, we investigated the effect of IT MK-801 (30 mugs) on histopathological changes in the spinal cord after morphine-induced spastic paraparesis. After IT morphine, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) glutamate concentration increased in group M compared with baseline and group C (P < 0.05). This increase persisted for 8 hours. IT MK-801 significantly reduced the number of black-stained alpha motor neurons after morphine-induced spastic paraparesis compared with the saline group. These data indicate that IT morphine induces spastic paraparesis with a concomitant increase in CSF glutamate, involved in NMDA receptor activation. We suggest that opioids could be neurotoxic in the context of spinal cord ischemia via activation of the NMDA receptor.\n",
      "Amiodarone represents an effective antiarrhythmic drug for cardioversion of new-onset atrial fibrillation (AF) and maintenance of sinus rhythm. We briefly describe two patients with new-onset atrial fibrillation who experienced acute and devastating low back pain within minutes of starting intravenous amiodarone loading. Notably, this side effect has never been reported in the medical literature. Clinicians should be aware of this reaction since rapid cessation of parenteral administration leads to complete resolution.\n",
      "Exposure to solar radiation, particularly its ultraviolet (UV) B component, has various harmful effects on human health. Some of these effects include sunburn cell formation, basal and squamous cell cancers, melanoma, cataracts, photoaging of the skin, and immune suppression. Among these various harmful effects of UV rays, skin cancer is the most worrying. Over the years, lifestyle changes have led to a significant increase in the amount of UV radiation received, leading to an increase in the incidence of skin cancer. Skin cancer development is a complex, multistage phenomenon involving three distinct stages illustrated by the stages of initiation, promotion, and progression. Each of these steps is mediated by alterations in various cellular, biochemical and molecular changes. Initiation, the first step in the process of carcinogenesis, is essentially an irreversible step during which genetic alterations occur in genes, ultimately leading to DNA modification and fixation of the mutation. Tumor promotion is the essential process of cancer development involving the clonal expansion of initiated cells giving rise to pre-cancerous and then malignant lesions, mainly through alteration of signal transduction pathways. Tumor progression involves the conversion of precancerous and malignant lesions into an invasive and potentially metastatic malignancy. All these processes of skin cancer development involve stimulation of DNA synthesis, DNA damage and proliferation, inflammation, immunosuppression, epidermal hyperplasia, cell cycle dysregulation, depletion of antioxidant defenses, impairment of signal transduction pathways, induction of cyclooxygenase, increased prostaglandin synthesis and induction of ornithine decarboxylase. Photochemoprevention has been appreciated as a viable approach to reduce the occurrence of skin cancer and, in recent years, the use of agents, particularly botanical antioxidants, present in the common diet and beverages consumed by the human population, have attracted considerable attention as photochemopreventive agents for human use. . Many of these agents have also found their way into skin care products. Although it is more common in Eastern countries, its popularity is increasing significantly in Western countries. In this article, we summarize the available information on laboratory studies of UVB-mediated signaling that can be exploited as targets for photochemoprevention. We suggest that the use of skin care products supplemented with proven chemopreventive agents, in conjunction with sunscreen use and educational efforts, could be an effective strategy to reduce UV-induced photodamage and skin cancer in men. The mechanistic bases for the use of such products are discussed.\n",
      "BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: The low prevalence of the C282Y mutation of the HFE gene in Japan means that the genetic background of hemochromatosis in Japanese patients remains unclear. In a previous report, we showed that 3 patients from the same family presented an AVAQ 594-597 deletion of the transferrin receptor gene (TfR2). This suggests that the TfR2 gene is involved in hemochromatosis in Japanese patients. DESIGN AND METHODS:Nine patients clinically diagnosed with hemochromatosis were included in the study. DNA was extracted from whole blood samples collected with informed consent. The HFE and TfR2 genes were analyzed by sequencing the coding region and splice sites. RESULTS: There were no mutations in the HFE gene. In the TfR2 gene, 2 new mutations, 1469T->G (L490R) and 1665delC (V561X), were found in 2 patients. A known variation, 714C->(I238M), was also found in the patient with L490R. The patient homozygous for L490R and I238M presented a mild manifestation of hemochromatosis at the age of 41 years. His liver was cirrhotic with parenchymal iron deposits and the result of a blood glucose test was consistent with diabetes mellitus. The patient homozygous for V561X presented with severe iron overload with the triad of cirrhosis, diabetes mellitus and skin pigmentation at the age of 58 years. INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS: In conjunction with the previous report, 5 of our 12 patients with hemochromatosis manifesting in middle age had mutations in the TfR2 gene. Thus, TfR2 plays a role in the pathogenesis of hemochromatosis in Japan.\n",
      "Primary hyperparathyroidism (pHPT) is a common endocrine disease that in more than 95% of cases is sporadic and is only in some cases caused by hereditary disorders, isolated or as part of multiple endocrine neoplasia (MEN1 and 2). Somatic mutations in the MEN1 gene have also been described in sporadic parathyroid tumors. In our study, we examined the presence of alterations of the MEN1 gene in a series of 39 patients operated on for sporadic pHPT (35 with parathyroid adenoma or hyperplasia, 4 with carcinoma). A genotype-phenotype correlation was also analyzed. After extraction of DNA from paraffin-embedded tissues, we PCR amplified and sequenced exons 2 to 10 of the MEN1 gene. Somatic MEN1 mutations were detected in 6 of 35 patients with benign parathyroid lesions examined (17.1%), whereas no alterations were found in the carcinomas. Four novel mutations in the MEN1 gene were identified as follows: a frameshift mutation (222insT, exon 2), a frameshift deletion (912delTA, exon 5), an in-frame deletion (835del18, exon 4), and a missense mutation (P291A, exon 6). ). Additionally, a missense mutation (L89R, exon 2) and a nonsense mutation (Q536X, exon 10) were previously reported. Additionally, two polymorphisms were also found: one allele carried an R171Q polymorphism (1/39 tumors), while a D418D (GAC/GAT) polymorphism was found in 15 and 8 tumors in heterozygosity (CT) and homozygosity (TT), respectively. In no case (mutations and/or polymorphisms) did we find a genotype-phenotype correlation. In conclusion, our data demonstrate the presence of somatic alterations of the MEN1 tumor suppressor gene in approximately one fifth of sporadic benign parathyroid tumors. The absence of genotype-phenotype correlation, however, suggests the involvement of other genetic/epigenetic factors in the full expression of the disease.\n",
      "BACKGROUND: Folate is essential for cell division, a major hallmark of in utero development. Dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) is necessary to convert folic acid used in supplements and for food enrichment and dihydrofolate produced by thymidylate synthase during DNA synthesis to the reduced folate forms used by the cell. OBJECTIVE: We sought to determine whether a recently discovered common deletion polymorphism in the DHFR gene is a risk factor for preterm delivery or low birth weight. DESIGN: We studied 324 pregnant women from Camden, NJ. Folate intake was calculated from folate supplement intake plus the average of two 24-hour boosters taken during pregnancy. Genomic DNA was extracted from women's leukocytes and genotyped. RESULTS: Women with a deletion allele had a significantly higher risk of preterm birth [adjusted odds ratio (AOR): 3.0; 95% CI: 1.0, 8.8; P < 0.05] than those without deletion allele. Women with both a DHFR deletion allele and low folate intake (<400 microg/d from diet and supplements) had a significantly higher risk of preterm birth (AOR: 5.5; CI at 95%: 1.5, 20.4; P = 0.01) and a significantly higher risk of premature birth. a higher risk of having a low birth weight infant (AOR: 8.3; 95% CI: 1.8, 38.6; P = 0.01) than women without the deletion allele and with a folate intake >/= 400 microg/day. CONCLUSIONS:The DHFR 19 base pair deletion allele may be a risk factor for preterm delivery. In the presence of low dietary folate, the allele may also be a risk factor for low birth weight. This may be a gene-environment interaction.\n",
      "Mutations in the steroid 5alpha-reductase type 2 (SRD5A2) gene in 46,XY subjects cause masculinization defects to varying degrees, due to reduced or impaired enzymatic activity. In this study, sequence abnormalities of the SRD5A2 gene were assessed by polymerase chain reaction with specific primers and automated sequencing analysis of DNA samples from 20 patients suspected of steroid 5alpha-reductase deficiency. type 2 from 18 Brazilian families. Eleven subjects had homozygous single base SRD5A2 mutations (two first cousins ​​and four unrelated patients with G183S, two with R246W, one with del642T, one with G196S and one with 217_218insC plus the A49T variant in heterozygosity), while four were compound heterozygotes (one with Q126R/IVS3+1G>A, one with Q126R/del418T, and two brothers with Q126R/G158R). Three patients were heterozygous for the A207D, G196S, and R266W substitutions. The V89L polymorphism was found in heterozygosity in one of them (with A207D) and in one case with an otherwise normal genetic sequence. The A49T variant was also detected in heterozygosity in the second case without other sequencing abnormalities. Four patients have previously undescribed mutations in the SRD5A2 gene: a single nucleotide deletion (del642T), a G158R amino acid substitution, a splice junction mutation (IVS3+1G>A), and the insertion of 'a cytosine (217_218insC) occurring at a CCCC. pattern. This is the first report of a single nucleotide insertion in the coding sequence of the SRD5A2 gene. In addition to these novel mutations, this investigation reveals the prevalence of the G183S substitution among a subset of Afro-Brazilian patients and presents evidence for the recurrence of previously known mutations.\n",
      "In this work, we studied the proband in a small nuclear family of Chinese and Dutch/German origin and identified two novel mutations in the type VII collagen gene leading to recessive dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa, Hallopeau-Siemens variant (HS- RDEB). The maternal mutation is a single base pair deletion of a cytosine nucleotide in exon 26, designated 3472delC, resulting in a frameshift and premature termination codon (PTC) in the same exon, 7 bp downstream of the site of the mutation. The paternal mutation is a G-->A transition located at the 5' donor splice site in intron 51, designated IVS51 + 1G-->A. This mutation leads to activation of a cryptic splice site, 32 bp downstream of the mutation site and subsequent aberrant out-of-frame splicing, resulting in two alternative mRNA transcripts and a downstream PTC. To our knowledge, these two mutations have not been reported previously. These findings expand the body of evidence for compound heterozygous mutations leading to HS-RDEB and provide the basis for prenatal diagnosis in this family.\n",
      "OBJECTIVE: To describe the unmasking of pheochromocytoma in a patient treated with amisulpride and tiapride. CASE SUMMARY: A 42-year-old white man developed acute hypertension accompanied by severe headache and vomiting 2 hours after the first doses of amisulpride 100 mg and tiapride 100 mg. Both medications were immediately discontinued and the patient recovered after further treatment with nicardipine and verapamil. Abdominal ultrasound showed an adrenal mass and postoperative histological examination confirmed the diagnosis of pheochromocytoma. DISCUSSION: Symptoms of drug-induced pheochromocytoma are often associated with the use of substituted benzamide medications, but the underlying mechanism is unknown. In our case, the use of the Naranjo probability scale indicated a possible relationship between hypertensive crisis and treatment with amisulpride and tiapride. CONCLUSIONS: As of March 24, 2005, this is the first reported case of hypertensive crisis induced by amisulpride and tiapride in a patient with pheochromocytoma. Physicians and other healthcare professionals should be aware of this potential side effect of tiapride and amisulpride.\n",
      "OBJECTIVE: In the present study, we sought to substantiate the putative importance of angiotensin I converting enzyme (ACE) on gastric cancer biology by investigating the influence of its genetic polymorphism on cancer progression gastric. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Genomic DNA was purified from peripheral blood mononuclear cells or tissue samples. The amplified fragments of the ACE gene were separated on agarose gels. D or I alleles were identified by the presence of fragments of 190 or 490 bp, respectively. Local expression of ACE was studied by immunohistochemistry. RESULTS: Twenty-four of 113 (21%) gastric cancer patients had genotype II, 57 (51%) had genotype ID, and 32 (28%) had genotype DD. The distribution of ACE genotypes did not differ significantly from that of the control group of 189 patients without gastric cancer. However, ACE genotypes were correlated with the number of lymph node metastases and Union Internationale Contra Cancrum (UICC) tumor stage. Patients with genotype II had a significantly lower number of lymph node metastases (P < 0.001) and a significantly lower UICC tumor stage (P = 0.01) than patients with genotype DD. No correlation was found between tumor type, tumor location, local tumor growth, distant metastasis, and ACE genotype. CEA expression in gastric cancer was studied by immunohistochemistry in 100 of 113 patients. CEA was expressed by endothelial cells in all samples (100%) and by tumor cells in 56 samples (56%). CONCLUSIONS: Our study shows that CEA is locally expressed in gastric cancer and that gene polymorphism influences metastatic behavior.\n",
      "OBJECTIVES: To determine the incidence of major bleeding and stroke in people aged 76 years and older with atrial fibrillation on dose-adjusted warfarin who were recently admitted to hospital. DESIGN:A retrospective observational cohort study. SETTING: A large healthcare network involving four tertiary hospitals. PARTICIPANTS: Two hundred and thirty-five patients aged 76 years and older admitted to a large health network between July 1, 2001 and June 30, 2002 for atrial fibrillation on warfarin were enrolled. MEASUREMENTS: Information regarding major bleeding episodes, stroke, and warfarin use was obtained from patients, their relatives, treating physicians, and medical records. RESULTS: Two hundred and twenty-eight patients (42% men) with a mean age of 81.1 years (range 76-94 years) were included in the analysis. Total follow-up on warfarin was 530 years (mean 28 months). There were 53 major hemorrhages, for an annual rate of 10.0%, including 24 (45.3%) life-threatening and five (9.4%) fatal hemorrhages. The annual rate of stroke after starting warfarin therapy was 2.6%. CONCLUSION: The rate of major bleeding was high in this elderly and frail group, but, excluding deaths, it caused no long-term sequelae and the rate of stroke on warfarin was low, demonstrating the effectiveness of warfarin treatment.\n",
      "BACKGROUND:Vitamin D binding protein (DBP) is the major systemic transporter of 1,25(OH)2D3 and is essential for its cellular endocytosis. There are two known polymorphisms in exon 11 of the DBP gene, resulting in amino acid variants: the GAT -> GAG substitution replaces aspartic acid with glutamic acid in codon 416; and the ACG -> AAG substitution in codon 420 leads to an exchange of threonine for lysine. These DBP variants result in differences in affinity for 1,25(OH)2D3. Correlations between DBP alleles and type 1 diabetes have been described in different populations. Therefore, we investigated the codon 416 polymorphism of the DBP gene for association with autoimmune markers of type 1 diabetes. DESIGN AND METHODS: The present analysis was a case-control study. 110 patients, 68 controls and 115 first-degree relatives were genotyped for the DBP polymorphism in codon 416. DNA typing of the DBP locus was carried out by the PCR restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) method. . RESULTS: Asp/Glu and Glu/Glu frequencies were significantly increased in diabetic subjects with detectable IA-2 antibodies (P < 0.01). In contrast, the DBP Glu-containing genotype was not accompanied by differences in the prevalence of GAD65 antibodies. These results confirm the role of the vitamin D endocrine system in the autoimmune process of type 1 diabetes.\n",
      "A single dose of valproic acid (VPA), a widely used antiepileptic drug, is associated with oxidative stress in rats, as recently demonstrated by elevated levels of 15-F(2t)-isoprostane (15-F(2t) )-IsoP ). To determine whether there was a temporal relationship between VPA-associated oxidative stress and hepatotoxicity, adult male Sprague-Dawley rats were treated ip with VPA (500 mg/kg) or saline at 0.9% (vehicle) once daily for 2, 4, 7, 10 or 14 days. Oxidative stress was assessed by determining plasma and hepatic levels of 15-F(2t)-IsoP, lipid hydroperoxides (LPO), and thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBAR). Plasma and hepatic 15-F(2t)-IsoP were elevated and reached a plateau after the second day of VPA treatment compared to control. Hepatic LPO levels were not elevated until day 7 of treatment (1.8-fold compared to control, p < 0.05). Hepatic and plasma TBARs only increased after 14 days (2 times compared to the control, p < 0.05). Liver toxicity was assessed based on serum alpha-glutathione S-transferase (alpha-GST) levels and by histology. Serum alpha-GST levels were significantly elevated on day 4, consistent with hepatotoxicity, as evidenced by the increasing incidence of liver capsule inflammation, necrosis, and steatosis throughout the 'study. Hepatic levels of VPA beta-oxidation metabolites decreased on day 14, while levels of 4-ene-VPA and (E)-2,4-diene-VPA were not elevated throughout. the study. Overall, these results indicate that VPA treatment results in oxidative stress, measured by 15-F(2t)-IsoP levels, which precedes the onset of necrosis, steatosis, and elevated levels of Serum alpha-GST.\n",
      "BACKGROUND: Acetaminophen (paracetamol--P) and nimesulide (N) are widely used analgesic-antipyretic/anti-inflammatory drugs. The rate of adverse hypersensitivity reactions to these agents is generally low. In contrast, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are commonly implicated in such reactions. Celecoxib (CE) is a new drug with high selectivity and affinity for COX-2 enzyme. OBJECTIVE: We evaluated the safety of EC in a group of patients with a documented history of adverse skin reactions to P and N associated or not with conventional NSAIDs. Methods: We studied 9 patients with hypersensitivity to P and N with or without reactions associated with classic NSAIDs. Diagnosis of P- and N-induced skin reactions was based on in vivo challenge. The placebo was administered blindly at the start of each challenge. After three days, a cumulative dose of 200 mg of EC in refracted doses was administered. After 2-3 days, a single dose of 200 mg was administered. All patients were observed for 6 hours after each challenge and checked again after 24 hours to exclude delayed reactions. The test was considered positive if one or more of the following symptoms appeared: erythema, rush, or urticaria-angioedema. RESULTS: No reactions were observed with placebo and eight patients (88.8%) tolerated EC. Only one patient developed moderate angioedema of the lips. CONCLUSION: A single hypersensitivity reaction to EC was documented among 9 patients highly intolerant to NSAIDs P and N. Thus, we conclude that EC is a reasonably safe alternative for use in subjects who do not tolerate P and N .\n",
      "BACKGROUND: T cell immunoglobulin mucin (TIM) proteins and their genetic variants have been suggested to play a role in the regulation of allergic diseases. OBJECTIVE:The genetic association of TIM-1 and TIM-3 gene sequence variants with asthma in an African-American population was investigated. METHODS: Case-control and familial association analyzes were performed for a total of 7 polymorphisms, including 3 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and 1 insertion/deletion polymorphism in TIM-1 and 3 SNPs in TIM- genes. 3. Exposure to hepatitis A virus, as judged by seropositivity, was also examined. RESULTS: In the case-control design, the frequencies of the TT genotype for the SNP rs2277025 and the homozygous deletion variant (157delMTTTVP) in the fourth exon of the TIM-1 gene were higher in asthma patients than in controls (odds ratio [OR], 2.779, P = 0.016 and OR, 3.09, P = 0.022 respectively). This association was supported by haplotype analysis of these SNPs and 2 additional SNPs (OR, 2.48; P = 0.004), as well as by family testing for the allele and haplotype carrying 157delMTTTVP (P = 0.009 and P = 0.048, respectively). Furthermore, this association seems to exist even in subjects seronegative for the hepatitis A virus in our data. None of the three TIM-3 gene variants revealed a significant association with asthma or asthma-related phenotypes. CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that genetic variants in the TIM-1 gene but not in the TIM-3 gene contribute to asthma susceptibility in this African-American population.\n",
      "Stiffness of the masseter muscles during general anesthesia is considered a warning sign of a possible episode of malignant hyperthermia. The decision to continue or interrupt the procedure depends on the urgency of the surgical procedure and the severity of the stiffness of the masseter muscle. Here we describe a case of severe stiffness of the masseter muscle (steel jaw) after administration of succinylcholine (Sch) during general anesthesia for rigid bronchoscopic removal of a tracheal foreign body. Anesthesia continued uneventfully with propofol infusion while all facilities were available to detect and treat malignant hyperthermia.\n",
      "OBJECTIVE:The anthracyclines daunorubicin and doxorubicin as well as the epipodophyllotoxin etoposide are potent DNA cleavage-enhancing drugs that are widely used in clinical oncology; however, myelosuppression and cardiac toxicity limit their use. Dexrazoxane (ICRF-187) is recommended for protection against anthracycline-induced cardiotoxicity. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Due to their widespread use, hematologic toxicity following concomitant administration of dexrazoxane and these three structurally different DNA cleavage enhancers was investigated: The sensitivity of human and murine blood progenitor cells to Etoposide, daunorubicin and doxorubicin +/- dexrazoxane were determined in granulocytes. -macrophage colony formation assays. Similarly, in vivo, B6D2F1 mice were treated with etoposide, daunorubicin and doxorubicin, with or without dexrazoxane over a wide dose range: after treatment, a complete hematological assessment was performed. RESULTS: Nontoxic doses of dexrazoxane reduced myelosuppression and weight loss caused by daunorubicin and etoposide in mice and antagonized their antiproliferative effects in the colony assay; however, dexrazoxane did not reduce myelosuppression, weight loss, or the in vitro cytotoxicity of doxorubicin. CONCLUSION: Although our results support the observation that dexrazoxane does not reduce either the hematologic or antitumor activity of doxorubicin clinically, the potent antagonism of daunorubicin activity raises concerns; possible interference with anticancer efficacy would certainly require renewed attention. Our data also suggest that a significant increase in etoposide dose may be possible with the use of dexrazoxane. Clinical trials in patients with brain metastases combining dexrazoxane and high doses of etoposide are underway with the aim of improving efficacy without worsening hematological toxicity. If successful, this represents an exciting mechanism for the pharmacological regulation of the side effects of cytotoxic chemotherapy.\n",
      "BACKGROUND: Exonic deletions in MSH2 and MLH1 contribute significantly to the mutation spectrum in HNPCC, and heterozygous exon copy number changes are not detected by conventional mutation screening methods. OBJECTIVES: We aimed to develop methods to screen for copy number changes in all exons of the MLH1 and MSH2 genes using a single multiplex amplifiable probe hybridization (MAPH) assay. METHODS: We developed a probe set consisting of probes from all 19 exons of MLH1 and 16 exons of MSH2, as well as 3 control probes, and applied it to screening for deletions and duplications using fluorescent detection of amplified fragments. RESULTS: We tested 73 DNA samples from controls and 50 from HNPCC patients in whom no point mutations were found, and detected 10 copy number changes among the patient samples. A deletion of approximately 1.4 kb including exon 3 of MSH2 was confirmed by amplification of a junction fragment and found to be the result of unequal recombination between Alu intronic elements. CONCLUSIONS: MAPH can detect exonic copy number changes in MLH1 and MSH2 in the DNA of HNPCC patients. Since searching for an exonic deletion or duplication makes full sequence analysis unnecessary, it may be more cost-effective to prescreen samples by MAPH or MLPA before searching for point mutations.\n",
      "Impaired insulin secretion is a fundamental defect of type 2 diabetes. The aim of this study was to determine whether single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in genes regulating insulin secretion (SLC2A2 [encoding GLUT2] , GCK, TCF1 [encoding HNF-1alpha], HNF4A, GIP and GLP1R) are associated with the conversion. from impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) to type 2 diabetes in participants in the Finnish Diabetes Prevention Study. Except for SLC2A2, other genes were not associated with type 2 diabetes risk. All four SNPs in SLC2A2 predicted conversion to diabetes, and rs5393 (AA genotype) increased type 2 diabetes risk threefold in the entire study population (odds ratio 3.04, 95% CI 1.34-6.88, P = 0.008). The risk of type 2 diabetes in carriers of the AA genotype was increased in the control group (5.56 [1.78-17.39], P = 0.003) but not in the intervention group. We conclude that SLC2A2 SNPs predict conversion to diabetes in obese subjects with IGT.\n",
      "RATIONALE: Nicotine and caffeine are licit psychoactive drugs widely used worldwide. Epidemiological studies have shown that they are generally used concomitantly. Although some studies in laboratory animals indicate clear pharmacological interactions between them, no studies have shown a specific interaction on anxiety responses. OBJECTIVES: The present study examines the effects of nicotine on anxiety induced by caffeine and another anxiogenic drug, pentylenetetrazole, in mice. The elevated plus maze test (EPM) was used to assess the effects of medications on anxiety. METHODS: Adult male Swiss Webster mice (25-32 g) received nicotine (0.05-0.25 mg/kg s.c.) or saline 10 minutes before caffeine injections (70 mg/kg i.p.) or pentylenetetrazole (15 and 30 mg/kg i.p.). . After 15 minutes, mice were assessed for their open and closed arm time and entries on the EPM during a 10-minute session. Locomotor activity was recorded for individual groups using the same treatment protocol with the EPM test. RESULTS: Nicotine (0.05-0.25 mg/kg) itself produced no significant effects in the EPM test, whereas caffeine (70 mg/kg) and pentylenetetrazole (30 mg/kg) produced an anxiogenic effect, apparent with a reduction in opening-arming time and entry. Pretreatment with nicotine (0.25 mg/kg) blocked anxiety induced by caffeine, but not by pentylenetetrazole. Administration of each drug and their combinations produced no effect on locomotor activity. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that the antagonistic effect of nicotine on caffeine-induced anxiety is specific to caffeine, instead of a nonspecific anxiolytic effect. Thus, this could extend current findings on the interaction between nicotine and caffeine.\n",
      "A 38-year-old woman was admitted for superior mesenteric vein (SMV) thrombosis, refractory to anticoagulant treatment. Plasma antithrombin activity was diminished and barely compensated by concentrated antithrombin preparation due to the high consumption rate. However, successful anticoagulation was achieved through administration of a direct thrombin inhibitor, argatroban. Family studies of antithrombin activity revealed that she suffered from congenital antithrombin type I deficiency. A novel heterozygous mutation in the antithrombin gene (insertion of a single T nucleotide at 7916 and 7917, Glu 272 stopping in exon 4) was identified. The administration of Argatroban would be effective in the treatment of congenital antithrombin deficiency with SMV thrombosis.\n",
      "Wolfram syndrome (WFS) is an autosomal recessive disorder characterized by early-onset diabetes mellitus, progressive optic atrophy, sensorineural deafness, and diabetes insipidus. Affected individuals may also present with renal tract abnormalities as well as neurological and psychiatric syndromes. WFS1 encoding a transmembrane protein was identified as the gene responsible for WFS. We report here a Japanese family in which two members presented this syndrome. In the WFS1 gene of these patients, we identified a new mutation, an insertion of nine nucleotides (AFF344-345ins). Additionally, one of these patients presented with preclinical hypopituitarism, an unusual feature of WFS. As only the two family members homozygous for the mutation had WFS, these data support the idea that this mutation is the cause of WFS.\n",
      "The SRY gene (sex determining region on the Y chromosome) acts as TDF and is necessary for the regulation of male sex determination. SRY represents a transcription factor belonging to the superfamily of genes sharing the high-mobility group-box (HMG-box) motif, which acts as a DNA-binding region. Deletion and inactivating mutations of SRY are among the known causes of XY sex reversal. Here, we described the screening of 10 patients with 46,XY sex reversal for mutations in the open reading frame (ORF) of the SRY gene. DNA was isolated from blood samples using standard techniques. A 609 bp fragment from the central part of the SRY gene was amplified using primers XES-2 and XES-7. The amplified PCR fragments were cloned into pUCm-T vectors and direct sequencing was performed on an ABI 377-3 automated DNA sequencer to detect the mutation. PCR restriction enzyme digestion was applied to detect the DNA sequencing results. In two patients, de novo mutations led to amino acid substitution. An A was replaced by a G in codon 38 upstream of the 5' boundary outside the HMG box of the SRY gene, resulting in the replacement of the amino acid glutamate with glycine. Another heterozygous T to A transition at nucleotide position +387 which codes for a tyrosine (Tyr) instead of a term, while his father was proven to have the wild-type sequence. These point mutations were confirmed by the restriction enzyme PCR method. As demonstrated by analysis of the Human Gene Mutation Database, homology search, and literature review, these two mutations have not been previously described and carried the total number of substitutions of nucleotides of the SRY (missense/nonsense) gene at 45. These results indicated that these amino acid substitutions may be responsible for sex inversion, not only within the HMG box but also outside the HMG box. The two novel mutations in the SRY gene provided valuable information to understand the molecular mechanism of the 46,XY female sex inversion patient.\n",
      "As a primary target of opioid drugs and peptides, the mu opioid receptor (OPRM1) plays a key role in pain perception and addiction. Genetic variants of OPRM1 have been implicated in drug predisposition, particularly the A118G single nucleotide polymorphism, leading to an N40D substitution, with an allele frequency of 10–32% and uncertain functions. We measured allele-specific OPRM1 mRNA expression in human autopsy brain tissues, using A118G as a marker. In 8 heterozygous samples measured, the A118 mRNA allele was 1.5 to 2.5 times more abundant than the G118 allele. Transfection into Chinese hamster ovary cells of a cDNA representing only the coding region of OPRM1, carrying adenosine, guanosine, cytidine, and thymidine at position 118, resulted in 1.5-fold mRNA levels lower only for OPRM1-G118, and more than 10 times. lower levels of OPRM1 protein, measured by Western blot and receptor binding assay. After transfection and inhibition of transcription with actinomycin D, analysis of mRNA turnover did not reveal differences in mRNA stability between A118 and G118 alleles, indicating a defect in transcription or processing. of mRNA. These results indicate that OPRM1-G118 is a functional variant with deleterious effects on mRNA and protein yield. Clarifying the functional relevance of polymorphisms associated with susceptibility to a complex disorder such as drug addiction provides a basis for clinical association studies.\n",
      "Phosphatidylethanolamine N-methyltransferase (PEMT) catalyzes the synthesis of phosphatidylcholine. PEMT knockout mice have fatty livers, and it is possible that in humans, nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is associated with PEMT gene polymorphisms. DNA samples from 59 humans without fatty liver and 28 humans with NAFLD were genotyped for a single nucleotide polymorphism in exon 8 of PEMT, leading to a V175M substitution. V175M is a loss-of-function mutation, determined by transient transfection of McArdle-RH7777 cells with constructs of the wild-type PEMT open reading frame or the V175M mutant. Met/Met at residue 175 (SNP loss of function) occurred in 67.9% of NAFLD subjects and in only 40.7% of control subjects (P < 0.03). For the first time, we report that a polymorphism in the human PEMT gene (V175M) is associated with decreased activity and may confer susceptibility to NAFLD.\n",
      "The objectives of this study were to examine vancomycin-induced oxidative stress (VCM) which promotes the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and to investigate the role of the expectorant agent erdosteine, which also has antioxidant properties on renal tissue against possible renal failure induced by VCM in rats. Rats were divided into three groups: sham, VCM, and VCM plus erdosteine. VCM was administered intraperitoneally (ip) at 200 mg kg(-1) twice daily for 7 days. Erdosteine ​​was administered orally. Administration of VCM to control rats significantly increased renal excretion of malondialdehyde (MDA) and N-acetyl-beta-d-glucosaminidase (NAG, a marker of renal tubular injury), but decreased the activities superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase (CAT). Administration of erdosteine ​​with VCM injections resulted in a significant decrease in renal excretion of MDA and urinary NAG, as well as an increase in SOD activity, but not CAT activity. in renal tissue compared to VCM alone. Erdosteine ​​showed histopathological protection against VCM-induced nephrotoxicity. There was significant dilation of tubular lumens, extensive vacuolation of epithelial cells, atrophy, desquamation, and necrosis in VCM-treated rats more than in rats in the control and erdosteine ​​groups. Erdosteine ​​caused a marked reduction in the extent of tubular damage. It is concluded that oxidative tubular injury plays an important role in VCM-induced nephrotoxicity and that modulation of oxidative stress with erdosteine ​​reduces VCM-induced renal injury both biochemically and histologically.\n",
      "The mechanisms and neural circuits involved in levodopa-induced dyskinesia are unclear. Using repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) over the supplementary motor area (SMA) in a group of patients with advanced Parkinson's disease, the authors investigated whether modulating SMA excitability could lead to modification of a dyskinetic state induced by continuous infusion of apomorphine. It was observed that 1 Hz rTMS markedly reduced drug-induced dyskinesias, whereas 5 Hz rTMS induced a slight but not significant increase.\n",
      "The PERIOD2 (PER2) gene is a key component of the molecular mechanism that generates circadian rhythms in mammals. A missense mutation in the human PER2 gene has previously been associated with advanced sleep phase syndrome (ASPS). We studied three other single nucleotide polymorphisms in the hPER2 gene, one downstream of the transcription start site (C-1228T), one in exon 2 in the 5' untranslated region (5'-UTR) ( C111G) and a missense mutation (G3853A) causing a substitution of glycine for glutamine in the predicted protein. Subjects selected from a group of 484 volunteers for extreme morning or evening preference, or intermediate daytime preference were genotyped with respect to the three polymorphisms (n = 35 for each group). While allele frequencies for the other two polymorphisms did not differ significantly between groups, the frequency of the 111G allele was significantly higher in subjects with an extreme morning preference (0.14) than in subjects having an extreme preference for the evening (0.03) (Fisher's exact test, two-sided P value = 0.031, odds ratio = 5.67). No significant differences in the frequency of the 111G allele were observed between either of these groups and subjects with an intermediate diurnal preference. Computational prediction indicated that the C111G polymorphism, which occurs 12 bases upstream of the translation initiation codon, could alter the secondary structure of the transcript. The PER2 111G allele associates with morning preference and is a potential candidate allele for ASPS.\n",
      "Nijmegen breakage syndrome (NBS) is an autosomal recessive human disease characterized by genomic instability and increased predisposition to cancer, particularly lymphoma and leukemia. Recently, significantly higher frequencies of heterozygous carriers of the Slavic NBS1 founder mutation, 657del5, were found in Russian children with sporadic lymphoid malignancies and in Polish adults with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL). Additionally, the 643C>T substitution (R215W) was also found in excess in children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). With the aim of evaluating the contribution of both mutations to the development of sporadic lymphoid malignancies, we analyzed DNA samples from a large group of Polish pediatric patients. The NBS1 657del5 mutation on one allele was found in 3 of 270 ALL patients and 2 of 212 children and adolescents with NHL; no carriers were found among 63 patients with Hodgkin lymphoma (HL). No carriers of the R215W variant were detected in any of the groups studied. The relative frequency of the 657del5 mutation was calculated from a total of 6,984 controls matched by patient residence, of which 42 were found to be carriers (frequency = 0.006). In the analyzed population with malignant tumors, an increased odds ratio for the occurrence of the 657del5 mutation was observed compared to the Polish control population (OR range 1.48-1.85, 95% confidence interval 1.18-2.65). This finding indicates that the frequency of mutation carriers was indeed increased in ALL and NHL patients (p < 0.05). However, heterozygosity of the NBS1 gene is not a major risk factor for malignant lymphoid tumors in children and adolescents.\n",
      "Most women with seasonal affective disorder (SAD) experience atypical vegetative symptoms such as overeating and weight gain when depressed. The serotonin 2C receptor (5-HT(2C)) plays a key role in controlling appetite and satiety. A 5-HT(2C) Cys 23 Ser substitution, encoded by a single nucleotide polymorphism (Cys 23 Ser) in the 5-HT(2C) gene, has been shown to influence 5-HT(2C) function. We hypothesized that Cys 23 Ser influences weight regulation in women with SAD. Two independent samples from Austria (162 women with SAD, 119 controls) and Canada (90 women with SAD, 42 controls) were genotyped for Cys 23 Ser. The influence on weight regulation was analyzed in patients with atypical characteristics. In Austrians, the distribution of genotypes differed between patients and controls (p = 0.044) and Cys 23 Ser was associated with weight (p = 0.039), body mass index (BMI; p = 0.038) and seasonal change in appetite (p = 0.031). All values ​​were highest in Cys/Cys carriers, intermediate in Cys/Ser carriers, and lowest in Ser/Ser carriers. In Canadian patients, Cys 23 Ser was associated with lowest lifetime BMI (p = 0.046), with lowest values ​​in Ser/Ser carriers. Our data provide evidence that Cys 23 Ser mediates the severity of weight regulation disorders in women with SAD, and dose-effect differences suggest a direct functional role for Cys 23 Ser in behavioral weight regulation. bodily.\n",
      "Recent reports have demonstrated that mutations in the OPHN1 gene are responsible for syndromic rather than nonspecific mental retardation. Posterior fossa abnormalities with cerebellar hypoplasia have been demonstrated in all male patients reported to date. Here we report a new family with X-linked mental retardation due to a mutation in OPHN1 and present unpublished data on two previously reported families, regarding the facial and psychological phenotype of affected male and female carriers. Our study confirms that cerebellar hypoplasia is a characteristic of this syndrome. Additionally, affected males have facial similarities that may aid diagnosis. Most female carriers have mild mental retardation and subtle facial changes.\n",
      "BACKGROUND: Markers of fibrinolysis, thrombin-activated fibrinolysis inhibitor (TAFI), tissue plasminogen activator (tPA), and plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) ) were studied for the evaluation of the short-term effects of raloxifene administration in postmenopausal women. METHODS: Thirty-nine postmenopausal women suffering from osteopenia or osteoporosis were included in this prospective, controlled clinical study. Twenty-five women received raloxifene hydrochloride (60 mg/day) plus calcium (500 mg/day). Age-matched controls (n = 14) received calcium only. Plasma levels of TAFI, tPA, and PAI-1 antigen were measured at baseline and after 3 months of treatment using commercially available ELISA kits. Individual variations were assessed by the Wilcoxon test. The relationship between these markers and demographic characteristics was studied. RESULTS: Three months of raloxifene treatment was associated with a significant decrease in plasma TAFI antigen concentrations (16% change, P < 0.01) and a significant increase in tPA antigen concentrations (25% change , P < 0.05). A significant correlation was found between baseline TAFI antigen concentrations and duration of amenorrhea (P < 0.05; r = 0.33). CONCLUSION: We suggest that the increased risk of venous thromboembolism due to raloxifene treatment may be related to increased tPA levels, but not to TAFI levels.\n",
      "Alpers syndrome is an autosomal recessive mitochondrial DNA depletion disorder that affects children and young adults. It is characterized by a progressive and fatal disease of the brain and liver. This syndrome has been associated with mutations in POLG, the gene encoding mitochondrial DNA polymerase (pol gamma). Most patients with Alpers syndrome were found to be compound heterozygotes, carrying two pathogenic mutations in trans at the POLG locus. POLG is a nuclear-encoded gene whose protein product is imported into mitochondria, where it is essential for mtDNA replication and repair. We studied skin fibroblasts from a patient with Alpers syndrome with the E873stop/A467T genotype. The E873stop mutation produces a premature termination codon (TAG) in exon 17. The A467T mutation produces a threonine to alanine substitution at a highly conserved site in exon 7. The allele carrying the stop codon (E873-TAG) should produce a truncated stop codon. , catalytically inactive polymerase. However, only the full-length pol gamma protein was detected by Western blot analysis. Here we show that transcripts containing this stop codon undergo nonsense-associated alternative splicing and nonsense-mediated decay. More than 95% of functional POLG mRNA came from the allele carrying the A467T mutation and less than 5% contained the E873stop mutation. These events ensured that virtually all of the POLG protein in the cell was expressed from the A467T allele. Therefore, the Alpers phenotype in this patient was a consequence of single-copy gene dose of the A467T allele and selective elimination of transcripts carrying the E873stop mutation.\n",
      "PURPOSE: Mutations in the CYP4V2 gene, a novel member of the cytochrome P450 gene family on chromosome 4q35, were recently identified in patients with Bietti crystal dystrophy (BCD). The aim of this study was to investigate the spectrum of mutations in this gene in BCD patients from Singapore and to characterize their phenotype. METHODS:Nine patients with BCD from six families were recruited into the study. The 11 exons of the CYP4V2 gene were amplified from patients' genomic DNA by polymerase chain reaction and then sequenced. Detailed characterization of the patients' phenotype was performed by fundal photography, visual field testing, fundal fluorescein angiography, and electroretinography (ERG). RESULTS: Three pathogenic mutations were identified; two mutations, S482X and K386T, were novel and found in three patients. The third mutation, a previously identified 15 bp deletion including the 3' splice site of exon 7, was found in all nine patients, with six patients carrying the deletion in the homozygous state. Haplotype analysis in patients and controls indicated a founder effect for this deletion mutation in exon 7. Clinical heterogeneity was present among patients. Compound heterozygotes for the deletion in exon 7 appeared to have more severe disease than patients homozygous for the deletion. There was a good correlation between clinical stage of disease and ERG changes, but age was not correlated with disease severity. CONCLUSIONS: This study identified novel mutations in the CYP4V2 gene as the cause of BCD. A high carrier frequency for the 15 bp deletion in exon 7 may exist in the Singapore population. Phenotype characterization showed clinical heterogeneity and age was not correlated with disease severity.\n",
      "Migraine is a common, debilitating primary headache disorder with significant mental, physical, and social health implications. The brain neurotransmitter 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT; serotonin) is involved in nociceptive pathways and has been implicated in the pathophysiology of migraine. With few genetic studies investigating the biosynthetic and metabolic enzymes governing 5-HT activity levels and their relationship to migraine, the objective of this study was to evaluate genetic variants within tryptophan hydroxylase human (TPH), amino acid decarboxylase (AADC) and monoamine oxidase A (MAOA) genes in migraine susceptibility. This objective was undertaken using a high-throughput DNA clustering experimental design, which has been shown to be a highly accurate, sensitive and specific method of estimating allele frequencies for single nucleotide polymorphism single, insertion deletion and variable number tandem repeat loci. Applying DNA clustering to a broad range of genetic loci provides greater scope in evaluating population-based genetic association study designs. Despite the application of this high-throughput genotyping method, negative results from the two-step DNA clustering design used to screen loci within the TPH, AADC, and MAOA genes did not confirm their role in susceptibility to migraine.\n",
      "Tics can be effectively treated with atypical antipsychotics such as risperidone, olanzapine, and ziprasidone. However, there are two case reports showing tic-like symptoms, including motor and phonic variants, occurring during treatment with quetiapine or clozapine. We present a 15-year-old girl with schizophrenia who developed frequent involuntary blinking movements after 5 months of treatment with amisulpride (1000 mg daily). The tic-like symptoms completely disappeared after we reduced the amisulpride dose to 800 mg per day. However, his psychosis recurred after dose reduction. We then gave him an additional 100 mg of quetiapine daily. She has been in complete remission on combination therapy for over a year and maintains reasonable function. No tic-like symptoms or other side effects have been reported. In addition to previously reported cases, our patient suggests that tic-like symptoms could occur in some vulnerable individuals during treatment with atypical antipsychotics such as quetiapine, clozapine or amisulpride.\n",
      "The cell's response to DNA damage and its ability to maintain genomic stability through DNA repair are crucial for preventing cancer initiation and progression. Therefore, polymorphism of DNA repair genes may affect the process of carcinogenesis. The importance of genetic variability in mismatch repair (MMR) gene components is well documented in colorectal cancer, but little is known about its role in breast cancer. hMSH2 is one of the crucial MMR proteins. We carried out a case-control study to test the association between two polymorphisms of the hMSH2 gene: an A --> G transition at position 127 producing an Asn --> Ser substitution at codon 127 (the Asn127Ser polymorphism) and a G - - > A transition at position 1032 leading to a Gly --> Asp change at codon 322 (the Gly322Asp polymorphism) and breast cancer risk and cancer progression. Genotypes were determined in peripheral blood lymphocyte DNA from 150 breast cancer patients and 150 age-matched women (controls) by restriction fragment length polymorphism and allele-specific PCR. We observed no correlation between the studied polymorphisms and breast cancer progression assessed by lymph node metastases, tumor size and Bloom-Richardson classification. A strong association between the occurrence of breast cancer and the Gly/Gly phenotype of the Gly322Asp polymorphism (odds ratio 8.39; 95% confidence interval 1.44-48.8) was found. Therefore, MMR might play a role in breast carcinogenesis and the Gly322Asp polymorphism of hMSH2 gene might be considered as a potential marker of breast cancer.\n",
      "Mutations in the p62/Sequestosome 1 (p62/SQSTM1) gene are responsible for both sporadic and familial forms of Paget's disease of bone (PDB). We initially described a methionine -> valine substitution at codon 404 (M404V) of exon 8, in the ubiquitin protein binding domain of the p62/SQSTM1 gene in an Italian PDB patient. Collection of data from the patient's pedigree provided evidence of a familial form of PDB. Extension of genetic analysis to other relatives of this family demonstrated segregation of the M404V mutation with the polyostotic PDB phenotype and allowed the identification of six asymptomatic gene carriers. DNA for mutational analysis of the exon 8 coding sequence was obtained from 22 subjects, 4 PDB patients and 18 clinically unaffected limbs. Of the five clinically affected family members, four had the M404V mutation and had the polyostotic form of PDB, with the exception of one patient with a single skeletal location evaluated by X-ray and one patient with polyostotic disease, who died. several years before the onset of the disease. DNA analysis. By reconstruction and mutational pedigree analysis, six unaffected subjects were found to carry the M404V mutation, representing potential asymptomatic gene carriers whose circulating alkaline phosphatase levels were recently assessed to still be within the normal range. Taken together, these results support a genotype-phenotype correlation between the M404V mutation in the p62/SQSTM1 gene and a polyostotic form of PDB in this family. The high penetrance of the PDB trait in this family as well as the study of asymptomatic gene carriers will allow us to confirm the proposed genotype-phenotype correlation and evaluate the potential use of mutational analysis of the p62/SQSTM1 gene in the detection early onset of loved ones at risk of PDB.\n",
      "OBJECTIVE:Congenital microcoria is a rare autosomal dominant developmental disorder of the iris associated with myopia and juvenile open-angle glaucoma. A link with the chromosomal locus 13q31-q32 has already been reported in a large French family. In the present study, a three-generation Asian Indian family with 15 members affected by congenital microcoria (pupils with diameter <2 mm) was investigated for linkage with candidate microsatellite markers at the 13q31-q32 locus. METHODS: Twenty-four family members were examined clinically and genomic DNA was extracted. Microsatellite markers at 13q31-q32 were amplified by PCR and run on an ABI Prism 310 genetic analyzer and genotyped with GeneScan analysis. Two-point and multipoint linkage analyzes were performed using the programs MLINK and SUPERLINK. RESULTS:The maximum two-point LOD scores of 3.5, 4.7, and 5.3 were found to coincide with consecutive markers D13S154, DCT, and D13S1280. Multipoint analysis revealed a 4 cM region encompassing D13S1300 to D13S1280 where the LOD remains slightly above 6.0. We thus confirm the location of the congenital microcoria locus at chromosomal locus 13q31-q32. Additionally, eight people with both microcoria and glaucoma were screened for the glaucoma genes: myocilin (MYOC), optineurin (OPTN), and CYP1B1. Using direct sequencing, a point mutation (144 G > A) resulting in a Q48H substitution in exon 1 of the MYOC gene was observed in five of eight glaucoma patients, but not in unaffected family members nor in 100 unrelated controls. CONCLUSIONS: We confirmed the localization of the congenital microcoria locus (MCOR) at 13q31-q32 in a large Indian family of Asian origin and conclude that current information suggests that it is a single locus disorder and genetically homogeneous. When combined with the initial linkage paper, our haplotype and linkage data map the MCOR locus to a 6-7 cM region between D13S265 and D13S1280. The DCT locus, a member of the tyrosinases family involved in pigmentation, is mapped in this region. The data presented here support the hypothesis that congenital microcoria is a potential risk factor for glaucoma, although this observation is complicated by partial segregation of MYOC Q48H (1q24.3-q25.2), a mutation known to be associated with glaucoma in India. Fine mapping and analysis of candidate genes continues in the hope that characterization of the microcoria gene will lead to a better understanding of the causes of microcoria and glaucoma. The relationship between microcoria, glaucoma and MYOC Q48H mutation in this family is discussed.\n",
      "PURPOSE: Nitric oxide has many beneficial functions in the human body in appropriate amounts, but it can also be harmful if produced in quantities greater than necessary and has therefore been studied in relation to several neurological and non-neurological disorders . In vitro and in vivo studies demonstrate a link between the inducible form of nitric oxide synthase, iNOS, and the neuropathological disorder glaucoma, one of the leading causes of blindness worldwide. In this study, we aimed to establish the genetic association between iNOS and primary open-angle glaucoma, POAG, and to find the functional element(s) related to the pathogenesis of the disease. METHODS: Two microsatellites, 1 insertion/deletion and 8 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the iNOS regulatory region were genotyped in 200 POAG patients and 200 age-matched controls. Additionally, the CCTTT microsatellite was examined for its protein binding capacity in an electrophoretic mobility shift assay, EMSA. RESULTS: There was a significant difference in the distribution of CCTTT microsatellite alleles between patients and controls. (CCTTT)14, which would have higher activity in a reporter construct, was significantly more abundant in POAG patients, while (CCTTT)10 and (CCTTT)13 were less common. In EMSA, the (CCTTT) 14 allele exhibited specific binding to nuclear proteins. CONCLUSIONS: These results, as well as other studies on this gene and the CCTTT microsatellite, establish, for the first time, a genetic association of iNOS with POAG and suggest a regulatory function of the microsatellite.\n",
      "There is now evidence suggesting a central role of the dopamine system in restless legs syndrome (RLS). For example, RLS symptoms may be significantly improved by levodopa and dopamine agonists, while central dopamine D2 receptor antagonists may induce or worsen RLS symptoms. To our knowledge, there are no previous reports indicating whether domperidone, a peripheral dopamine D2 receptor antagonist, can also induce or worsen RLS symptoms. Mirtazapine, the first specific noradrenergic and serotonergic antidepressant (NaSSA), has been associated with RLS in several recent publications. Here, the authors report a comorbid depressed patient with postprandial dyspepsia who developed RLS after mirtazapine was added to his domperidone treatment. Our patient began experiencing RLS symptoms only after being treated with mirtazapine, and his RLS symptoms completely resolved upon discontinuation of his mirtazapine. Such a temporal relationship between mirtazapine use and RLS symptoms in our patient did not support a potentiating effect of domperione on mirtazapine-associated RLS. However, physicians should be aware of the possibility that mirtazapine may be associated with RLS in some individuals, particularly those receiving concomitant dopamine D2 receptor antagonists.\n",
      "The effect of ritanserin (5-HT2 antagonist) on amnesia induced by scopolamine (muscarinic cholinergic antagonist) in the Morris water maze (MWM) was investigated. Rats were divided into eight groups and cannulated bilaterally in the CA1 region of the hippocampus. One week later, they were repeatedly given vehicles (saline, DMSO, saline+DMSO), scopolamine (2 microg/0.5 microl saline/side; 30 min before training), ritanserin (2, 4 and 8 microg/0.5 microl DMSO/side; 20 min before training) and scopolamine (2 microg/0.5 microl; 30 min before ritanserin injection)+ritanserin ( 4 microg/0.5 microl DMSO) through cannulas daily. Animals were tested for four consecutive days (4 trials/day) in MWM during which the position of the hidden platform was unchanged. During the fifth day, the platform was raised above the water surface in another position to assess the functioning of the motor, motivational and visual systems. Results showed a significant increase in escape latencies and distances traveled to find a platform in the scopolamine-treated group compared to the saline group. Rats treated with ritanserin (4 microg/0.5 microl/side) showed a significant decrease in the mentioned parameters compared to the DMSO treated group. However, co-administration of scopolamine and ritanserin resulted in a significant decrease in escape latencies and distances traveled compared to scopolamine-treated rats. Our results show that microinjection of ritanserin into the CA1 region of the hippocampus improves scopolamine-induced amnesia.\n",
      "Cardiotoxicity is a rare complication occurring during the treatment of malignancies with 5-fluorouracil (5-FU). Here we report the case of a 70-year-old man with 5-FU-induced cardiotoxicity, in whom an elevated serum level of alpha-fluoro-beta-alanine (FBAL) was observed. The patient, who had unresectable metastases of colon cancer to the liver and lungs, was referred to us for chemotherapy from an affiliated hospital; he had no history of heart disease. After admission, the patient received a continuous intravenous infusion of 5-FU (1000 mg/day), during which precordial pain with right bundle branch block occurred concomitantly with an elevated serum FBAL concentration of 1 955 ng/ml. The precordial pain and electrocardiographic changes resolved spontaneously after discontinuation of 5-FU. As precordial pain in this patient was considered to be due to 5-FU-induced cardiotoxicity, 5-FU administration was discontinued. Instead, oral administration of S-1 (a 5-FU derivative), 200 mg/day twice a week, was instituted, because S-1 has a strong inhibitory effect on dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase, which catalyzes the degradation of 5-FU. in FBAL. The serum concentration of FBAL then decreased to 352 ng/ml, the same as the value measured on the first day of S-1 administration. Thereafter, no cardiac symptoms were observed. The patient achieved a partial response 6 months after starting S-1 treatment. The experience of this case, as well as a review of the literature, suggests that FBAL is linked to 5-FU-induced cardiotoxicity. S-1 can be safely administered to patients with 5-FU-induced cardiotoxicity.\n",
      "A homozygous deletion of the DOCK8 (cytokinesis dedicator 8) locus at chromosome 9p24 was found in a lung cancer cell line by array-CGH analysis. Cloning of the complete DOCK8 cDNA led us to define that the DOCK8 gene encodes a protein consisting of 2,099 amino acids. DOCK8 was expressed in various human organs, including the lungs, and was also expressed in alveolar, bronchiolar, and type II bronchial epithelial cells, which are considered progenitors of lung cancer cells. DOCK8 expression was reduced in 62/71 (87%) primary lung cancers compared to normal lung tissue, and the reduction occurred regardless of the histological type of lung cancer. 5-Aza-2'-deoxy-cytidine and/or Trichostatin A treatments induced DOCK8 expression in lung cancer cell lines with reduced DOCK8 expression. Therefore, epigenetic mechanisms, including DNA methylation and histone deacetylation, were indicated to be involved in the downregulation of DOCK8 in lung cancer cells. Further screening revealed homozygous deletions of the DOCK8 gene in a gastric and breast cancer cell line. DOCK family proteins have been shown to play a role in regulating cell migration, morphology, adhesion, and growth. Thus, the present results suggest that genetic and epigenetic inactivation of DOCK8 is involved in the development and/or progression of lung cancer and other cancers by disrupting these regulations.\n",
      "Current knowledge of genetic alterations in glioblastomas is largely based on genetic analyzes of tumors originating primarily from Caucasian patients in the United States and Europe. In the present study, screening for several key genetic alterations was performed on 77 primary (de novo) glioblastomas in Japanese patients. SSCP followed by DNA sequencing revealed TP53 mutations in 16 of 73 (22%) glioblastomas and PTEN mutations in 13 of 63 (21%) cases analyzed. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) showed EGFR amplification in 25 of 77 cases (32%) and homozygous p16 deletion in 32 of 77 cases (42%). Quantitative microsatellite analysis revealed 10q LOH in 41 of 59 (69%) glioblastomas. The frequencies of these genetic alterations were similar to those reported for primary glioblastomas in the Swiss population. As previously observed for glioblastomas in Europe, there was a positive association between EGFR amplification and p16 deletion (p = 0.009), whereas there was an inverse association between TP53 mutations and deletion of p16. p16 (p = 0.049) in glioblastomas in Japan. Multivariate analyzes showed that radiotherapy was significantly predictive of longer survival of patients with glioblastoma (p = 0.002). SSCP followed by DNA sequencing of the kinase domain (exons 18-21) of the EGFR gene revealed mutations in 2 of 69 (3%) glioblastomas in Japan and in 4 of 81 (5%) glioblastomas in Switzerland. The allele frequencies of polymorphisms at codon 787 CAG/CAA (Gln/Gln) in glioblastomas in Japan were G/G (82.4%), G/A (10.8%), A/A (6.8%) ), corresponding to G 0.878 versus A 0.122, significantly different from those of glioblastomas in Switzerland: G/G (27.2%), G/A (28.4%), A/A (44.4%), corresponding to G 0.414 versus A 0.586 (p < 0.0001). These results suggest that primary glioblastomas in Japan have similar genetic alterations to those in Switzerland, suggesting a similar molecular basis in Caucasians and Asians, despite different genetic backgrounds, including different status of an EGFR gene polymorphism.\n",
      "BACKGROUND: Familial partial lipodystrophy (Dunnigan) type 3 (FPLD3, Mendelian Inheritance in Man [MIM] 604367) results from heterozygous mutations in PPARG encoding peroxisomal proliferator-activated receptor gamma. Dominant negative and haploinsufficiency mechanisms have been suggested for this disease. METHODS: We present a Canadian FPLD3 kindred with an affected mother who had loss of arm and leg fat, but no increase in facial, neck, suprascapular, or abdominal fat. She had profound insulin resistance, diabetes, severe hypertriglyceridemia, and recurrent pancreatitis, while her prepubescent daughter had normal fat distribution but elevated plasma triglycerides and C-peptide and cholesterol. with depressed high-density lipoproteins. RESULTS: Mother and daughter were each heterozygous for the nonsense mutation PPARG Y355X, whose in vitro protein product was transcriptionally inactive with no dominant negative activity against the wild-type receptor. Additionally, the mutant protein appeared distinctly unstable. CONCLUSION: Taken together with previous studies of human PPARG mutations, these results suggest that PPAR-gamma deficiency due to either haploinsufficiency or substantial loss of activity due to dominant negative interference of product function normal allele can each contribute to the FPLD3 phenotype.\n",
      "BACKGROUND: Sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) is the most common cause of death in the postperinatal period in Germany. Recently, a lethal phenotype characterized by sudden infant death syndrome with testicular dysgenesis (SIDDT) was identified as being due to loss of function and mutations in the TSPYL1 gene. OBJECTIVE: The aim of the study was to reveal a possible role of TSPYL1 in SIDS. METHODS: DNA samples from 126 SIDS cases and 261 controls were studied. RESULTS: We found five sequence variations, each of which caused an amino acid substitution. No Hardy Weinberg disequilibrium or significant differences in allele frequencies between patients and controls were observed for any variation. In one patient, an amino acid polymorphism p.F366L was found heterozygous, which could not be displayed in controls. A pathogenic implication of this substitution, conserved in primates and rodents, cannot be completely excluded. As SIDDT is the result of homozygous TSPYL1 mutations, this heterozygous exchange cannot alone explain the sudden death of this child. The reported mutation associated with SIDDT (457_458insG) was not detectable in our cohort. CONCLUSION: No association of sequence variations in the TSPYL1 gene and SIDS was found in a German cohort. Genetic analysis of TSPYL1 appears to have limited importance in the differential diagnosis of SIDS without testicular dysgenesis.\n",
      "COX-2 is a key enzyme in the conversion of arachidonic acid to prostaglandins. Prostaglandins produced by COX-2 are involved in inflammation and the pain response in different tissues of the body. Accumulating evidence from epidemiological studies, carcinogenic chemical-induced rodent models, and clinical trials indicates that COX-2 plays a role in human carcinogenesis and is overexpressed in prostate cancer tissues. We examined whether COX-2 gene sequence variants were associated with prostate cancer risk. We analyzed a large population-based case-control study of Prostate Cancer in Sweden (CAPS), including 1378 cases and 782 controls. We evaluated 16 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) covering the entire COX-2 gene in 94 subjects in the control group. Five SNPs had a minor allele frequency of more than 5% in our study population and these were genotyped in all cases, patients and control subjects and gene-specific haplotypes were constructed. A statistically significant difference in allele frequency between cases and controls was observed for 2 of the SNPs (+3,100 T/G and +8,365 C/T), with an odds ratio of 0.78 (CI to 95% = 0.64-0.96) and 0.65 (95% CI = 0.45-0.94) respectively. In the haplotype analysis, 1 haplotype carrying the variant allele of +3100 T/G and +8365 C/T, with a population frequency of 3%, was also significantly associated with decreased risk of prostate cancer (p = 0.036, global simulation). p-value = 0.046). This study supports the hypothesis that inflammation is involved in prostate carcinogenesis and that sequence variation within the COX-2 gene influences prostate cancer risk.\n",
      "Several studies have suggested that regulator of G protein signaling 4 (RGS4) may be a positional and functional candidate gene for schizophrenia. Three single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) located at the promoter region (SNP4 and SNP7) and intron 1 (SNP18) of RGS4 were verified in different ethnic groups. Positive results were reported in these SNPs with different numbers of combinatorial SNP haplotypes. In this study, these three SNP markers were genotyped in 218 schizophrenia pedigrees from Taiwan (864 individuals) for association analysis. Among these three SNPs, neither SNP4, SNP7, SNP18 showed significant association with schizophrenia in single-locus association analysis, nor did any composition of the three SNP haplotypes show significant association with schizophrenia diagnosed by the DSM-IV. Our results fail to support RGS4 as a candidate gene for schizophrenia when assessed from these three SNP markers.\n",
      "A relatively high frequency of germline genomic rearrangements in MLH1 and MSH2 has been reported in Lynch syndrome patients (HNPCC) from different ethnic populations. To investigate the underlying molecular mechanisms, we characterized the DNA breakpoints of 11 germline deletions, six for MLH1 and five for MSH2. Distinct deletion patterns were found for the two genes. The five cases of MSH2 deletions result exclusively from unequal intragenic recombination mediated by repetitive Alu sequences. In contrast, five out of six MLH1 deletions are due to recombinations involving sequences without significant homology (P = 0.015). Detailed analysis of DNA breakpoints in both genes, previously characterized by other groups, validated the observation that Alu-mediated unequal recombination is the major deletion type in MSH2 (n = 34) , but not in MLH1 (n = 21). (P<0.0001). Plotting the distribution of known DNA breakpoints among the introns of both genes showed that the highest breakpoint density is co-localized with the highest Alu density. Our study suggests that Alu is a factor promoting genomic recombinations in MLH1 and MSH2, and that local Alu density might be involved in the formation of the deletion pattern.\n",
      "In recent years, working memory deficits have been reported among MDMA (3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine, ecstasy) users. The present study aimed to assess the impact of MDMA consumption on three distinct central executive processes (set shifting, inhibition, and memory updating) as well as “prefrontal” mediated social and emotional judgment processes. . Fifteen polyecstasy users and 15 control non-ecstasy polyusers completed a general drug use questionnaire, the Brixton Spatial Anticipation task (set shifting), the Backward Digit Span procedure (memory updating), inhibition of return (inhibition), an emotional intelligence scale, the Tromso social intelligence scale and the dysexecutive questionnaire (DEX). Compared to polydrug controls without MDMA, MDMA polyusers showed impairments in set shifting and memory updating, as well as in social and emotional judgment processes. These last two deficits remained significant after controlling for the consumption of other drugs. These data further support the hypothesis that cognitive processes mediated by the prefrontal cortex could be impaired by recreational ecstasy use.\n",
      "Although 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA or ecstasy) has been shown to damage serotonergic (5-HT) neurons in the brain in animals and possibly humans, little is known about the long-term consequences 5-HT neurotoxic lesions induced by MDMA on functions. in which 5-HT is involved, such as cognitive function. Since 5-HT transporters play a key element in regulating 5-HT synaptic transmission, it may be important to control for the potential covariance effect of a polymorphism in the transporter 5 promoter gene region. -HT (5-HTTLPR) when studying the effects. of MDMA as well as cognitive functioning. The aim of the study was to investigate the effects of moderate and heavy MDMA consumption on cognitive function, as well as the effects of long-term MDMA abstention, in subjects genotyped for 5-HTTLPR. A second goal of the study was to determine whether these effects differ for women and men. Fifteen moderate MDMA users (<55 lifetime tablets), 22 heavy MDMA+ users (>55 lifetime tablets), 16 former MDMA+ users (last tablet > 1 year ago) and 13 controls were compared on a battery neuropsychological tests. DNA from peripheral nuclear blood cells was genotyped for 5-HTTLPR using standard polymerase chain reaction methods. A significant group effect was observed only on tasks related to memory function (p = 0.04), but not on reaction times (p = 0.61) or attention/attention functioning. execution. (p = 0.59). Heavy and ex-MDMA+ users performed significantly worse on memory tasks than controls. In contrast, no signs of memory problems were observed in moderate MDMA users. No significant effects of 5-HTTLPR or sex were observed. Although consumption of MDMA in amounts that may be considered \"moderate\" is not associated with impaired memory functioning, excessive consumption of MDMA can lead to lasting memory impairment. No effects of 5-HTTLPR or sex on memory function or MDMA use were observed.\n",
      "OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to analyze the value of germline and tumor thymidylate synthase (TS) genotyping as a prognostic marker in a series of colorectal cancer patients receiving adjuvant fluorouracil-based therapy. (FU). Patients and methods: One hundred and twenty-nine patients with colorectal cancer treated homogeneously with FU plus levamisole or leucovorin as adjuvant treatment were included. The TS enhancer region, 3RG > C single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) and TS 1494del6 polymorphisms were evaluated in fresh-frozen normal mucosa and tumor. Mutational analyzes of TS and allelic imbalances were studied in all primary tumors and in 18 additional metachronic metastases. TS protein immunostaining was evaluated in an expanded series of 214 tumors. Multivariate Cox models were adjusted for stage, differentiation, and location. RESULTS: Tumor genotyping (frequency of allelic loss, 26%) showed that the 3R/3R genotype was associated with a better prognosis (hazard ratio [HR] = 0.38; 95% CI, 0.16 to 0 .93; P = 0.020 for recessive type). model). 3RG > C SNP genotyping did not add prognostic information. The TS 1494del6 tumor allele (frequency of allelic loss, 36%) was protective (for each allele with deletion, based on an additive model, HR = 0.42; 95% CI, 0.22 to 0, 82; P = 0.0034). Both polymorphisms were in strong linkage disequilibrium (D' = 0.71, P < 0.001), and the 3R/-6 base pair (bp) haplotype showed a significant overall survival benefit compared to the most prevalent 2R/+6bp (HR = 0.42; 95% CI, 0.20 to 0.85; No TS point mutations were detected in primary tumors or metastases. Protein immunostaining TS was not associated with survival or with any of the genotypes analyzed. CONCLUSION: The TS 1494del6 tumor genotype may be a prognostic factor in FU-based adjuvant treatment of patients with colorectal cancer.\n",
      "Children with status epilepticus have continuous or rapidly repeating seizures that can be life-threatening and cause permanent changes in the brain and behavior. The extent to which status epilepticus causes auditory discrimination deficits is unknown. A naturalistic method of auditory location discrimination was used to evaluate this question using an animal model of status epilepticus. Male Sprague-Dawley rats were injected with saline on postnatal day (P) 20 or with a convulsive dose of pilocarpine at P20 or P45. Pilocarpine, daily, induced status epilepticus; status epilepticus at P45 resulted in CA3 cell loss and spontaneous seizures, whereas P20 rats showed no cell loss or spontaneous seizures. Mature rats were trained in sound source localization and sound-silence discrimination. Control rats (P20 saline) acquired both discriminations immediately. In rats with status epilepticus (P20), acquisition of sound source location discrimination was moderately impaired. Rats in status epilepticus (P45) failed to acquire sound source localization or sound-silence discrimination. Status epilepticus in rats causes long-term, age-dependent impairment of auditory discrimination. This impairment may explain one of the causes of impaired auditory location discrimination in humans.\n",
      "Cystic fibrosis (CF) was one of the first inherited diseases for which gene therapy was seriously considered as a realistic treatment option and, as such, has long been a paradigm for gene therapy of inherited diseases. However, despite the cloning of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator gene in 1989, more than 15 years later, practical gene therapy for cystic fibrosis has not been achieved. There are a number of reasons for this, and analysis of the specific issues that have delayed the successful development of gene therapy for cystic fibrosis also provides general insight into the practical complexities involved in the development of gene therapy for cystic fibrosis. hereditary. Problems that have prevented the application of gene therapy for cystic fibrosis to date include the lack of appropriate gene delivery technologies, the complexity of host-vector interactions, the biology of the pulmonary airways and the nature of the pathology observed in individuals. with CF. We will discuss the history of gene therapy for cystic fibrosis with specific reference to these and other questions currently preoccupying the field: namely, the question of which vectors appear suitable for gene delivery into pathways respiratory tract in cystic fibrosis, which cells should be targeted, how defenses of the airway epithelium can be overcome or evaded to enable efficient gene transmission, how to ensure safe and long-term transgene expression and need to identify relevant surrogate measures that can be used to evaluate the outcomes of gene therapy in patients with cystic fibrosis.\n",
      "A 74-year-old man with depressive symptoms was admitted to a psychiatric hospital for insomnia, loss of appetite, exhaustion, and agitation. Medical treatment was initiated at a daily dose of 20 mg paroxetine and 1.2 mg alprazolam. On the 10th day of treatment with paroxetine and alprazolam, the patient presented with marked psychomotor delay, disorientation and severe muscle rigidity accompanied by tremors. The patient had fever (38.2 degrees C), fluctuating blood pressure (between 165/90 and 130/70 mg mm Hg), and severe extrapyramidal symptoms. Laboratory tests showed elevated levels of creatine phosphokinase (2,218 IU/L), aspartate aminotransferase (134 IU/L), alanine aminotransferase (78 IU/L), and BUN (27.9 mg /ml). The patient received bromocriptine and diazepam to treat his symptoms. 7 days later, the fever disappeared and the patient's serum CPK levels normalized (175 IU/L). This patient presented with symptoms of neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS), demonstrating that NMS-like symptoms can occur following combined treatment with paroxetine and alprazolam. The adverse drug reaction score obtained by the Naranjo algorithm was 6 in our case, indicating a probable relationship between the patient's NMS-like adverse symptoms and the combination treatment used in this case. The involvement of physiological and environmental aspects specific to this patient was suspected. Several risk factors for NMS should be noted in elderly depressed patients whose symptoms often include dehydration, agitation, malnutrition, and exhaustion. Cautious therapeutic intervention is necessary in cases involving elderly patients with depression.\n",
      "We report an unusual case of an inherited disease of the desmosomal protein plakophilin 1, leading to a syndrome of ectodermal dysplasia and skin fragility. The affected 6-year-old boy had red skin at birth and subsequently developed skin fragility, progressive plantar keratoderma, nail dystrophy, and alopecia. Skin biopsy revealed widening of intercellular spaces in the epidermis and a reduced number of small, poorly formed desmosomes. Mutation analysis of the plakophilin 1 PKP1 gene revealed a homozygous deletion of C at nucleotide 888 in exon 5. This mutation differs from the PKP1 gene pathology reported in 8 previously published individuals with this rare genodermatosis . However, all cases show similar clinical features, highlighting the importance of functional plakophilin 1 in maintaining desmosomal adhesion in the skin, as well as the role of this protein in certain aspects of ectodermal development.\n",
      "BACKGROUND: Drug-induced long QT syndrome is a serious adverse drug reaction. Methadone prolongs the QT interval in vitro in a dose-dependent manner. In the hospital setting, the frequency of QT prolongation with methadone treatment, its dose dependence, and the importance of cofactors such as drug interactions remain unknown. METHODS: We performed a systematic retrospective study comparing active or former IV drug users receiving methadone and those not receiving methadone among all inpatients over a 5-year period at a tertiary care hospital. A total of 167 patients receiving methadone met the inclusion criteria and were compared to a control group of 80 injection drug users not receiving methadone. In addition to methadone dose, 15 demographic, laboratory, and pharmacological variables were considered as potential risk factors for QT prolongation. RESULTS: Among 167 patients undergoing methadone maintenance treatment, the prevalence of QTc interval prolongation to 0.50 seconds ((1/2)) or more was 16.2%, compared with 0. % in 80 control subjects. Six patients (3.6%) in the methadone group presented torsade de pointes. QTc interval length was weakly but significantly associated with daily methadone dose (Spearman's rank correlation coefficient, 0.20; P < 0.01). Multivariate regression analysis attributed 31.8% of QTc variability to methadone dose, cytochrome P-450 3A4 drug interactions, hypokalemia, and impaired liver function. CONCLUSIONS: QT prolongation in methadone maintenance patients hospitalized in a tertiary care center is a common finding. Methadone dose, presence of cytochrome P-450 3A4 inhibitors, potassium levels, and liver function contribute to QT prolongation. Long QT syndrome may occur with low doses of methadone.\n",
      "Loss of endothelial cell-derived nitric oxide (NO) in hypertension is a hallmark of arterial dysfunction. Experimental hypertension created by NO elimination, however, involves mechanisms in addition to a decrease in arterial vasodilator activity. These include increased endothelin-1 (ET-1) release, increased sympathetic nervous system activity, and elevated tissue oxidative stress. We hypothesized that increased venous smooth muscle (venomotor) tone plays a role in Nomega-nitro-L-arginine (LNNA) hypertension through these mechanisms. Rats were treated with the NO synthase inhibitor LNNA (0.5 g/L in drinking water) for 2 weeks. The mean blood pressure of conscious rats was 119 +/- 2 mm Hg in control rats and 194 +/- 5 mm Hg in LNNA rats (P < 0.05). The carotid arteries and vena cava were removed to measure isometric contraction. Peak norepinephrine contraction was slightly reduced in LNNA arteries compared to control rats, while peak ET-1 contraction was significantly reduced (54% control). Maximal vena cava contraction to norepinephrine (37% control) was also reduced, but no change in response to ET-1 was observed. Mean circulatory filling pressure, an in vivo measure of venomotor tone, was not elevated in LNNA hypertension 1 or 2 weeks after LNNA. The superoxide scavenger tempol (30, 100 and 300 micromol kg(-1), IV) did not modify blood pressure in control rats but caused a dose-dependent decrease in LNNA rats (-18 +/- 8, -26 +/- 15 and -54 +/- 11 mm Hg). Similarly, ganglion blockade with hexamethonium caused a significantly greater decline in LNNA hypertensive rats (76 +/- 9 mm Hg) compared to control rats (35 +/- 10 mm Hg). The carotid arteries, vena cava, and sympathetic ganglia of LNNA rats had higher basal superoxide levels than those of control rats. These data suggest that although NO deficiency increases oxidative stress and sympathetic activity in arterial and venous vessels, the impact on veins does not make a major contribution to this form of hypertension.\n",
      "To evaluate the antioxidant effects of atorvastatin (atorva) on dexamethasone (dex)-induced hypertension, 60 male Sprague-Dawley rats were treated with 30 mg/kg/day atorva or tap water. for 15 days. Dex increased systolic blood pressure (SBP) from 109 +/- 1.8 to 135 +/- 0.6 mmHg and plasma superoxide (5711 +/- 284.9 saline, 7931 +/- 392, 8 U/ml dex, P < 0.001). In this prevention study, SBP in the atorva + dex group increased from 115 +/- 0.4 to 124 +/- 1.5 mmHg, but it was significantly lower than that in the dex only group (P' < 0 .05). Atorva reversed dex-induced hypertension (129 +/- 0.6 mmHg, versus 135 +/- 0.6 mmHg P' < 0.05) and decreased plasma superoxide (7931 +/- 392.8 dex, 1187 +/- 441.2 atorva + dex, P < 0.0001). Plasma nitrate/nitrite (NOx) was decreased in dex-treated rats compared to saline-treated rats (11.2 +/- 1.08 microm, 15.3 +/- 1.17 microm, respectively, P < 0.05). Atorva did not affect plasma NOx or thymus weight. Thus, atorvastatin prevented and reversed dexamethasone-induced hypertension in rats.\n",
      "Hepatocyte nuclear factor 4alpha (HNF4alpha) is a transcription factor necessary for normal function of the human liver and pancreatic islets. We investigated whether single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of HNF4A, encoding HNF4alpha, influenced the conversion of impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) to type 2 diabetes mellitus in subjects in the STOP-NIDDM trial. This trial aimed to evaluate the effect of acarbose compared to placebo in the prevention of type 2 diabetes mellitus. Eight SNPs spanning the intragenic and alternative P2 promoter regions of HNF4A were genotyped in study samples at the TaqMan allelic discrimination tests help. Three SNPs in the P2 promoter region (rs4810424, rs1884614 and rs2144908) were in almost complete association (D' > 0.97, r(2) > 0.95) and therefore only rs4810424 was included in further analyzes . Women carrying the less frequent C allele of rs4810424 had a 1.7-fold increased risk [95% confidence interval (CI) 1.09-2.66; P = 0.020] for conversion to diabetes compared with women with the common genotype after adjusting for age, treatment group (placebo or acarbose), smoking, baseline weight, and weight change. No association was found in men. Haplotype analysis based on three SNPs (rs4810424, rs2071197 and rs3818247) representing blocks of linkage disequilibrium in our study population indicated that conversion to type 2 diabetes mellitus depended on the number of risk alleles in different haplotypes in women. Our results suggest that HNF4A SNPs and their haplotypes predispose to type 2 diabetes mellitus in women in the STOP-NIDDM study population.\n",
      "Multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 (MEN1) is characterized by enteropancreatic parathyroid, endocrine, and pituitary adenomas as well as a germline mutation in the MEN1 gene. We describe 2 families with MEN1 with novel mutations in the MEN1 gene. One family was of Turkish origin and the index patient had primary hyperparathyroidism (PHPT) plus prolactinoma; three family members had only PHPT. The index patient from the second family was a 46-year-old woman of Chinese origin living in Taiwan. This patient presented with a complaint of epigastric pain and watery diarrhea for the past 3 months and had undergone a subtotal parathyroidectomy and enucleation of a pancreatic islet cell tumor approximately 10 years previously. There was also a prolactinoma. Analysis of the MEN1 gene sequence from leukocyte genomic DNA revealed heterozygous mutations in both probands. The Turkish patient and her affected relatives all presented a heterozygous A to G transition at codon 557 (AAG-->GAG) of exon 10 of MEN1 which results in a replacement of lysine by glutamic acid. The Chinese index patient and one of her siblings had a heterozygous mutation at codon 418 of exon 9 (GAC -> TAT) which results in a substitution of aspartic acid by tyrosine. In conclusion, we identified 2 new missense mutations in the MEN1 gene.\n",
      "The cell's sensitivity to mutagens and its ability to repair DNA damage are important for the induction, promotion and progression of cancer. Mutagen sensitivity and DNA repair efficiency can be affected by variation in several genes, including DNA repair genes. The hOGG1 gene encodes base excision repair glycosylase and RAD51 specifies a key protein in homologous recombination repair. Both may be involved in the repair of oxidative DNA damage, which can contribute to stomach cancer. In the present work, we determined the level of basal and oxidative DNA damage and the kinetics of elimination of hydrogen peroxide-induced DNA damage in peripheral blood lymphocytes of 30 patients with gastric cancer and 30 healthy individuals. Study measurements of DNA damage and repair were correlated with genotypes of common hOGG1 and RAD51 gene polymorphisms: a G-->C transversion at position 1245 of the hOGG1 gene producing a Ser-- substitution >Cys at codon 326 (the Ser326Cys polymorphism) and a G-->C substitution at position 135 (5'-non region translated) of the RAD51 gene (the G135C polymorphism). DNA damage and repair were assessed by single-cell alkaline gel electrophoresis (comet assay) assisted by DNA repair enzymes: endonuclease III (Nth) and formamidopyrimidine-DNA glycosylase (Fpg). , preferentially recognizing oxidized DNA bases. Polymorphism genotypes were determined by restriction fragment length polymorphism PCR. We observed a strong association between the occurrence of gastric cancer, impaired DNA repair in human lymphocytes and the G/C genotype of the G135C polymorphism of the RAD51 gene. Additionally, there was a strong correlation between this genotype and the occurrence of stomach cancer in subjects with a high level of oxidatively damaged DNA. We observed no correlation between the Ser1245Cys polymorphism of the hOGG1 gene and gastric cancer, including subjects with impaired DNA repair and/or high levels of endogenous oxidative DNA damage. Therefore, our results suggest that the G135C polymorphism of the RAD51 gene could be linked to gastric cancer through modulation of the cellular response to oxidative stress and that this polymorphism could be a useful additional marker in this disease, alongside genetic and/or genetic indicators. or environmental. oxidative stress.\n",
      "BACKGROUND:Hereditary hypophosphatemic rickets with hypercalciuria (HHRH) is a rare metabolic disorder, characterized by hypophosphatemia and rickets/osteomalacia with increased serum 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D [1,25-(OH)(2)D ] leading to hypercalciuria. OBJECTIVE: Our objective was to determine whether mutations in the SLC34A3 gene, which codes for the type IIc sodium-phosphate cotransporter, are responsible for the occurrence of HHHR. DESIGN AND SETUP: Mutation analysis of adjacent exons and introns in the SLC34A3 gene was performed in a university research laboratory and medical center. PATIENTS OR OTHER PARTICIPANTS: Members of two unrelated families with HHRH participated in the study. RESULTS: Two affected siblings in one family were homozygous for a 101 bp deletion in intron 9. Haplotype analysis of the SLC34A3 locus in the family showed that the two deletions are on different haplotypes. An unrelated individual with HHRH was a compound heterozygote for an 85 bp deletion in intron 10 and a G-to-A substitution at the last nucleotide of exon 7. The deletion of intron 9 (and probably both other mutations) identified in this study causes aberrant RNA splicing. Sequence analysis of the deleted regions revealed the presence of direct repeats of homologous sequences. CONCLUSION: HHHR is caused by biallelic mutations in the SLC34A3 gene. Haplotype analysis suggests that the two intron 9 deletions arose independently. The identification of three independent deletions in introns 9 and 10 suggests that the SLC34A3 gene may be susceptible to unequal crossover due to sequence misalignment during meiosis.\n",
      "Experimental and clinical evidence highlights the role of the central histaminergic system in the pathogenesis of schizophrenia. The present study was designed to investigate the effect of histamine H(3) receptor ligands on neuroleptic-induced catalepsy, apomorphine-induced climbing behavior, and amphetamine-induced locomotor activities. in mice. Catalepsy was induced by haloperidol (2 mg/kg po), while apomorphine (1.5 mg/kg s.c.) and amphetamine (2 mg/kg s.c.) were used respectively to study the behavior climbing and locomotor activities. (R)-alpha-methylhistamine (RAMH) (5 microg icv) and thiooperamide (THP) (15 mg/kg i.p.), per se, did not cause catalepsy. Administration of THP (3.75, 7.5, and 15 mg/kg i.p.) 1 h before haloperidol resulted in a dose-dependent increase in catalepsy times (P < 0.05). However, pretreatment with RAMH significantly reversed this effect of THP (15 mg/kg i.p.). RAMH per se showed a significant reduction in locomotor time, distance traveled and average speed, but THP (15 mg/kg i.p.) per se had no effect on these parameters. On amphetamine-induced hyperactivity, THP (3.75 and 7.5 mg/kg i.p.) reduced locomotor time, distance traveled and average speed (P < 0.05). Pretreatment with RAMH (5 microg icv) could partially reverse these effects of THP (3.75 mg/kg ip). Apomorphine-induced climbing behavior was reduced in THP-treated animals. Such an effect was, however, reversed in the presence of RAMH. THP exhibited an antipsychotic-like profile by potentiating haloperidol-induced catalepsy, reducing amphetamine-induced hyperactivity, and reducing apomorphine-induced escalation in mice. These effects of THP were reversed by RAMH, indicating the involvement of histamine H(3) receptors. The results suggest potential for H(3) receptor antagonists in improving refractory cases of schizophrenia.\n",
      "PURPOSE: Extrapyramidal syndrome (EPS) is most commonly affected by typical antipsychotic medications that have a high affinity to the D2 receptor. Recently, many research groups have reported the positive relationship between genetic variations of the DRD2 gene and therapeutic response in schizophrenia patients due to the role of receptor variations in modulating receptor expression. In this study, we evaluate the role that DRD2 plays in chlorpromazine-induced EPS in schizophrenia patients. METHODS: We identified seven SNPs (single nucleotide polymorphism) (-141Cins>del, TaqIB, TaqID, Ser311Cys, rs6275, rs6277 and TaqIA) in the DRD2 gene in 146 hospitalized schizophrenia patients (59 with EPS and 87 without EPS according to the study Simpson- Angus Scale) treated with chlorpromazine after 8 weeks. Alleles of all loci were determined by PCR (polymerase chain reaction). RESULTS: TaqID, Ser311Cys and rs6277 polymorphisms were not polymorphic in the population recruited in the present study. No statistical significance was found in the distribution of alleles of -141Cins>del, TaqIB, rs6275 and TaqIA or in the estimated haplotypes (consisting of TaqIB, rs6275 and TaqIA) in case of linkage disequilibrium between the two groups. CONCLUSION: Our results do not strongly support the idea that genetic variation in the DRD2 gene plays a major role in the individually variable adverse effect induced by chlorpromazine, at least in Chinese patients with schizophrenia. Our results confirmed a previous study on the relationship between DRD2 and EPS in Caucasians.\n",
      "Eslicarbazepine acetate (BIA 2-093, S-(-)-10-acetoxy-10,11-dihydro-5H-dibenzo/b,f/azepine-5-carboxamide) is a new antiepileptic drug, currently in phase III clinical trials. , designed with the aim of improving efficacy and safety compared to the structurally related drugs carbamazepine (CBZ) and oxcarbazepine (OXC). We investigated the effects of oral eslicarbazepine acetate treatment in a whole animal model in which partial seizures can be repeatedly induced on different days without changes in seizure threshold or patterns. In animals treated with threshold doses of picrotoxin, the mean number of seizures was 2.3+/-1.2 and the mean seizure duration was 39.5+/-8.4 s. Pretreatment with a dose of 30 mg/kg 2 hours before microinfusion of picrotoxin prevented convulsions in 75% of rats. Lower doses (3 and 10 mg/kg) did not suppress seizures. However, after administration of 10 mg/kg, significant reductions in seizure duration (24.3+/-6.8 s) and seizure number (1.6+/-0.34) were observed. observed. No adverse effects of eslicarbazepine acetate were observed in the behavioral/EEG patterns studied, including sleep/wake cycle, at the doses studied.\n",
      "A recent addition to the list of widely confirmed type 1 diabetes risk loci is the PTPN22 gene encoding a lymphoid-specific phosphatase (Lyp). However, evidence supporting the role of PTPN22 in type 1 diabetes comes entirely from the study of a single coding single nucleotide polymorphism, 1858C/T. In the present study, the haplotype structure of the PTPN22 region was determined and individual haplotypes were tested for their association with type 1 diabetes in family testing. The 1858T risk allele occurred on a single haplotype strongly associated with type 1 diabetes (P = 7.9 x 10(-5)). After controlling for the effects of this allele, two other haplotypes were found to be weakly associated with type 1 diabetes (P < 0.05). Sequencing of the PTPN22 coding region on these haplotypes revealed a novel variant (2250G/C) that is predicted to result in a nonsynonymous amino acid substitution. Analysis of PTPN22 transcripts from a subject heterozygous for this variant indicated that it interfered with normal mRNA splicing, resulting in a premature termination codon after exon 17. These results support the conclusion that the The 1858C/T allele is the major risk variant for type 1 diabetes. in the PTPN22 locus, but they suggest that other uncommon coding variants at PTPN22 may also contribute to the risk of type 1 diabetes.\n",
      "Polymorphisms in proinflammatory cytokine genes have been shown to be associated with the risk of gastric cancer, among which changes in IL1B-31T/C and IL1B-511C/T have been well studied due to the possibility that they can alter IL1B transcription. The signal transduction target upon stimulation of interleukin 1 beta (IL1beta), nuclear factor kappa B (NFkappaB), supports cancer development, with signal transduction mediated by signaling of cell surface antigen (FAS) associated with FS-7 cells. Based on recent articles describing the prognostic roles of NFkappaB polymorphisms and functions on cancer development, we sought to determine whether Japanese gastric cancer patients were affected by IL1B -31/-511 polymorphisms. and FAS-670. A case-control study was conducted on patients with gastric adenocarcinoma (n = 271) and age- and gender-matched control subjects (n = 271). We observed strong linkage disequilibrium between the T allele at -511 and the C allele at -31 and between the C allele at -511 and the T allele at -31 in IL1B in cases and controls ( R(2) = 0.94). . Neither IL1B-31, -511 nor FAS-670 polymorphisms showed significantly different risks of gastric adenocarcinoma. Although FAS-670 polymorphisms showed no significant differences, the proportion of subjects with IL1B-31TT (or IL1B-511CC) increased depending on stage (P trend = 0.019). In particular, stage IV subjects had twice the likelihood of having the IL1B-31TT (or IL1B-511CC) genotype compared to stage I subjects. These observations suggest that IL1B-31TT and IL1B -511CC are associated with disease progression.\n",
      "X-linked mental retardation is traditionally divided into syndromic (S-XLMR) and non-syndromic (NS-XLMR) forms, although the boundaries between these phenotypes are beginning to disappear and mutations in a single gene, e.g. PQBP1 , can cause S. -XLMR as well as NS-XLMR. Here we report two maternal cousins ​​with an apparently X-linked phenotype of mental retardation (MR), microphthalmia, choroid coloboma, microcephaly, renal hypoplasia, and spastic paraplegia. By multipoint linkage analysis with markers covering the entire X chromosome, we mapped the disease locus to a 28 Mb interval between Xp11.4 and Xq12, including the BCOR gene. A BCOR missense mutation was described in a family with Lenz microphthalmia syndrome, a phenotype with substantial overlapping features with those described in the two cousins. However, no BCOR gene mutations were found in either patient. Subsequent analysis of mutations in PQBP1, located within the bounded binding interval in Xp11.23, revealed a 2-bp deletion, c.461_462delAG, which was associated with disease. Notably, the same mutation is associated with Hamel cerebropalatocardiac syndrome, another form of S-XLMR. Haplotype analysis suggests germline mosaicism of the 2 bp deletion in the maternal grandmother of the two affected individuals. In summary, our results demonstrate for the first time that PQBP1 mutations are associated with an S-XLMR phenotype including microphthalmia, thus expanding the clinical spectrum of phenotypes associated with PQBP1 mutations.\n",
      "Chloroacetaldehyde (CAA) is a metabolite of the alkylating agent ifosfamide (IFO) and potentially responsible for renal damage following antitumor treatment with IFO. Depletion of sulfhydryl (SH) groups has been reported in cell culture, animal and clinical studies. In this work, the effect of CAA on primary cultured human proximal tubule cells (hRPTEC) was investigated. CAA toxicity was determined by protein content, cell number, LDH release, trypan blue exclusion test, and caspase-3 activity. Free thiols were measured by the Ellman method. CAA reduced the number of hRPTEC cells and proteins, induced a loss of free intracellular thiols and an increase in necrosis markers. CAA, but not acrolein, inhibited the cysteine ​​proteases, caspase-3, caspase-8, and cathepsin B. Activation of caspase by cisplatin was inhibited by CAA. In cells stained with fluorescent dyes targeting lysosomes, CAA induced an increase in lysosomal size and lysosomal escape. The effects of CAA on cysteine ​​protease and thiol activities could be reproduced in cell lysate. Acidification, which slowed the reaction of CAA with thiol donors, could also attenuate the effects of CAA on necrosis markers, thiol depletion, and cysteine ​​protease inhibition in living cells. Thus, CAA reacts directly with cellular proteins and non-protein thiols, mediating its toxicity on hRPTEC. This effect can be reduced by acidification. Therefore, urinary acidification could be an option to prevent IFO nephropathy in patients.\n",
      "We report a case of Gitelman syndrome (GS) in a dizygotic twin who presented at the age of 12 years with failure to thrive, metabolic alkalosis, hypomagnesemia and hypokalemia with inappropriate kaliuresis and idiopathic intracranial hypertension. with bilateral papilledema (pseudotumor cerebri). The patient, her twin sister and her mother also had cerebral cavernous malformations. Given its early onset and normocalciuria, Bartter syndrome was diagnosed first. However, mutation analysis showed that the proband is a compound heterozygote for 2 mutations in SLC12A3: a serine to leucine substitution at amino acid position 555 (p.Ser555Leu) and a novel guanine transition to cytosine at the 5' splice site of intron 22. (c.2633+1G>C), providing the molecular diagnosis of GS. These mutations were not detected in 200 normal chromosomes and were distributed within the family. Analysis of complementary DNA showed that the heterozygous nucleotide change c.2633+1G>C caused the appearance of 2 RNA molecules, 1 normal transcript and 1 skipping the entire exon 22 ( r.2521_2634del). Potassium and magnesium supplementation improved clinical symptoms and resulted in catch-up growth, but vision remained impaired. Three similar associations between Bartter syndrome/GS and pseudotumor cerebri have been found in the literature, suggesting that electrolyte abnormalities and secondary aldosteronism may play a role in idiopathic intracranial hypertension. This study provides additional evidence for the phenotypic heterogeneity of GS and its association with severe manifestations in children. This also shows independent segregation of familial cavernomatosis and GS.\n",
      "Immunocompromised kidney transplant recipients (RTRs) are predisposed to non-melanoma skin cancers (NMSCs), primarily squamous cell carcinomas (SCCs). We analyzed skin lesions of RTRs with aggressive tumors for p53 gene changes, the presence of human papillomavirus (HPV) DNA in relation to p53 codon 72 genotype, and XPD repair gene polymorphisms. . We detected 24 p53 mutations in 15/25 (60%) NMSCs, 1 deletion and 23 base substitutions, the majority (78%) being UV-specific C to T transitions at bipyrimidine sites. Importantly, 35% (6/17) are tandem mutations, including 4 UV-signature CC to TT transitions possibly linked to modulated DNA repair caused by the immunosuppressive drug cyclosporin A (CsA). We found 8 p53 mutations in 7 out of 17 (41%) precancerous actinic keratoses (AKs), suggesting that p53 mutations are early events in RTR skin carcinogenesis. Immunohistochemical analysis shows a good correlation between p53 accumulation and mutations. HPV DNA was detected in 78% of skin lesions (60% basal cell carcinomas, 82% AKs, and 79% SCCs). Thus, immunosuppression increased the risk of HPV infections, mainly epidermodysplasia verruciformis, suspected of playing a role in the development of skin cancer. No association was found between HPV status and p53 mutation. Furthermore, p53 codon 72 or the frequencies of three XPD genotypes of RTR are comparable to those of control populations. The p53 mutation spectrum, showing a high level of CC to TT mutations, shows that the UV component of sunlight is the main risk factor and that modulated DNA repair by immunosuppressive drug treatment may be significant in the skin carcinogenesis of RTR.\n",
      "Nonketotic hyperglycinemia is a disorder of amino acid metabolism in which a defect in the glycine cleavage system results in accumulation of glycine in the brain and other body compartments. In the classic form, it manifests as neonatal apnea, intractable convulsions and hypotonia, followed by significant psychomotor delay. A significant subgroup of children with nonketotic hyperglycinemia are atypical variants that present heterogeneously. This report describes a patient with mild language delay and mental retardation who was found to have nonketotic hyperglycinemia following her presentation with acute encephalopathy and chorea shortly after initiation of valproate therapy.\n",
      "BACKGROUND: Meningococcal disease occurs after colonization of the nasopharynx by Neisseria meningitidis. Surfactant proteins (SP)-A and SP-D are airway pattern recognition molecules that activate inflammatory and phagocytic defenses after binding to microbial sugars. Variation in surfactant protein genes affects the expression and function of these molecules. METHODS: Allelic frequencies of SP-A1, SP-A2, and SP-D were determined by polymerase chain reaction in 303 patients with microbiologically proven meningococcal disease, including 18 deceased patients and 222 healthy control subjects. RESULTS: Homozygosity of the 1A1 allele of SP-A2 increased the risk of meningococcal disease (odds ratio [OR], 7.4; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.3-42.4) ; Carrying 1A5 reduced the risk (OR, 0.3; 95% CI, 0.1-0.97). An analysis of multiple SP-A single-nucleotide polymorphisms demonstrated that homozygosity of alleles encoding lysine (in 1A1) rather than glutamine (in 1A5) at amino acid 223 in the protein recognition domain carbohydrates was associated with an increased risk of meningococcal disease (OR, 6.7; 95% CI, 1.4-31.5). Carriage of alleles encoding lysine at residue 223 was seen in 61% of patients who died, compared with 35% of those who survived (age-adjusted OR, 2.9; 95% CI). , 1.1-7.7). Genetic variation in SP-A1 and SP-D was not associated with meningococcal disease. CONCLUSIONS: Genetic polymorphism resulting in the substitution of glutamine for lysine at residue 223 in the carbohydrate recognition domain of SP-A2 increases susceptibility to meningococcal disease, as well as the risk of death.\n",
      "OBJECTIVE: The authors compared the results of 4-month treatment with olanzapine versus risperidone in patients with a first episode of schizophrenia spectrum disorders. METHOD: One hundred and twelve subjects (70% male; mean age = 23.3 years [SD = 5.1]) with a first episode of schizophrenia (75%), schizophreniform disorder (17%), or schizo- (8%) were randomly assigned to treatment with olanzapine (2.5 to 20 mg/day) or risperidone (1 to 6 mg/day). RESULTS: Response rates did not differ significantly between olanzapine (43.7%, 95% CI = 28.8% to 58.6%) and risperidone (54.3%, 95% CI = 39 .9% to 68.7%). Among those who responded to treatment, more subjects in the olanzapine group (40.9%, 95% CI = 16.8% - 65.0%) than in the risperidone group (18.9%, 95% CI = 16.8% - 65.0%) % = 0% - 39.2%) received subsequent non-compliant assessments. response criteria. Negative symptom scores and measures of parkinsonism and akathisia did not differ between medications. Extrapyramidal symptom severity scores were 1.4 (95% CI = 1.2-1.6) with risperidone and 1.2 (95% CI = 1.0-1.4) with l olanzapine. Significantly greater weight gain was observed with olanzapine than with risperidone: the increase in weight at 4 months compared to initial weight was 17.3% (95% CI = 14.2% - 20.5%) with olanzapine and 11.3% (95% CI = 8.4% - 14.3%) with risperidone. Body mass index at baseline and 4 months was 24.3 (95% CI = 22.8-25.7) compared to 28.2 (95% CI = 26.7-29.7) with olanzapine and 23.9 (95% CI = 22.5-25.3) versus 26.7 (95% CI = 25.2-28.2) with risperidone. CONCLUSIONS: Clinical results with risperidone were equal to those with olanzapine, and the response may be more stable. Olanzapine may have an advantage in motor side effects. Both drugs caused rapid and substantial weight gain, but weight gain was greater with olanzapine.\n",
      "Systemic sclerosis (SSc) is a connective tissue disease characterized by early widespread microangiopathy with disrupted angiogenesis. The endoglin gene (ENG) encodes a transmembrane glycoprotein that acts as an accessory receptor for the transforming growth factor beta (TGF-beta) superfamily and is crucial for the maintenance of vascular integrity. A 6-base insertion in intron 7 (6bINS) of ENG has been reported to be associated with microvascular disruption. OBJECTIVES: Our objective was to study the relationship between 6bINS and the vascular complication of pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) in SSc in a French Caucasian population. METHODS: Two hundred and eighty cases of SSc containing 29/280 with PAH diagnosed by catheterization were compared to 140 patients with osteoarthritis. Genotyping was performed by polymerase chain reaction-based fluorescence and direct sequencing of genomic DNA. RESULTS: Polymorphism was at Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium. We observed a significantly lower frequency of the 6bINS allele in SSc patients with associated PAH compared to controls [10.3 vs 23.9%, P = 0.01; odds ratio (OR) 0.37, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.15-0.89] and a trend compared to SSc patients without PAH (10.3 vs 20.3%, P = 0.05; OR: 0.45, 95% CI: 0.19-1.08). Genotypes carrying the 6bINS allele were also less common in SSc patients with PAH than in controls (20.7 vs. 42.9%, P = 0.02). CONCLUSIONS: Thus, the frequency of 6bINS differs between SSc patients with or without PAH, suggesting the involvement of ENG in this devastating vascular complication of SSc.\n",
      "Thyroid hormone resistance (THR) is an inherited syndrome characterized by elevated serum thyroid hormones (TH), failure to suppress pituitary secretion of thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), and variable peripheral tissue reactivity. at HT. The disorder is associated with various mutations in the thyroid hormone receptor beta (TRbeta). Here we report a novel natural RTH mutation (E333D) located in the large carboxy-terminal ligand binding domain of TRbeta. The mutation was identified in a 22-year-old French woman consulted because of increasing overweight. Biochemical tests showed elevated free thyroxine (T4: 20.8 pg/ml (normal, 8.5-18)) and triiodothyronine (T3: 5.7 pg/ml (normal, 1.4-18) 4)) in serum, as well as an inappropriately suppressed TSH level. 4.7 mU/ml (normal, 0.4-4). Serum tests from his father and brother also showed biochemical abnormalities consistent with RTH. Direct sequencing of the TRbeta gene revealed a heterozygous 1284A>C transition in exon 9 resulting in the substitution of glutamic acid 333 with the aspartic acid residue (E333D). Further functional analyzes of the new TRbeta mutant were carried out. We found that the E333D mutation did not significantly affect the affinity of the receptor for T3 or alter the formation of heterodimers with the retinoid X receptor (RXR) when bound to DNA. However, in transient transfection assays, the E333D TRbeta mutant exhibited altered transcriptional regulation on two distinct upregulated thyroid response elements (F2 and DR4-TRE) as well as the downregulated human TSHalpha promoter. Additionally, dominant inhibition of the transactivation function of the wild-type TRbeta homolog was observed on both a positive (F2-TRE) and negative (TSHalpha) promoter. These results strongly suggest that the E333D TRbeta mutation is responsible for the RTH phenotype in the proposita family.\n",
      "We previously reported a robust association between an allelic haplotype of “Disturbed in Schizophrenia 1” (DISC1) and schizophrenia in a nationwide collection of Finnish schizophrenia families. This specific DISC1 allele was subsequently identified as being associated with visual working memory, selectively in males. The DISC1 association with schizophrenia has since been replicated in several independent study samples from different populations. In this study, we conditioned our sample of Finnish families on the presence of the Finnish provisional risk allele for DISC1 and reanalyzed our genome-wide analysis data of 443 markers based on this stratification. Two additional loci showed evidence of linkage (LOD > 3) and included a locus on 16p13, close to the gene encoding NDE1, which has been shown to interact biologically with DISC1. Although none of the observed links remained significant after several simulation correction tests, further analysis of NDE1 revealed an association between a tag haplotype and schizophrenia (P = 0.00046) specific to women, which was was found to be significant (P = 0.011) after several tests. test correction. Our results would support the concept that initial genetic discoveries in multifactorial diseases will aid in the identification of other components of a complex genetic etiology. Notably, this and other converging lines of evidence highlight the importance of DISC1-related functional pathways in the etiology of schizophrenia.\n",
      "CYP1A1 activates environmental procarcinogens and catalyzes oxidative estrogen metabolism and is likely to play an important role in the etiology of prostate cancer. To evaluate this phenomenon, the association between two single nucleotide polymorphisms (A to G transition in exon7 leading to the substitution of amino acids Ile462Val and T3801C in 3'UTR) of the CYP1A1 gene in prostate cancer was analyzed in a case-control study involving 100 individuals South Indian population. The estimated relative risk was significantly elevated for individuals with a w1/m1 genotype at 3'UTR of the CYP1A1 gene (OR-4.64; 95% CI = 1.51-14.86; P < 0.01) while that the CYP1A1 Ile/Val (w2/m2) genotype on exon 7 was found to be associated with a decreased risk of prostate cancer (OR-0.17; 95% CI = 0.02-0.89; P = 0.03). Stratified analysis of genotypes with age of onset and tumor grade showed that the w1/m1 genotype was significantly associated with early age of onset; however, tumor grades did not have a significant association with variant genotypes. Thus, the present study indicates that individuals with the w1/m1 variant genotype have an increased risk, while those with the w2/m2 genotype have a reduced risk of prostate cancer.\n",
      "The aim of this study was to evaluate the interactive effects of chronic anabolic-androgenic steroid (AAS) exposure and cerebral serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine, 5-HT) depletion on the behavior of pubertal male rats. Serotonin was depleted from postnatal day 26 with parachlorophenylalanine (PCPA 100 mg/kg, every other day); controls received saline. At puberty (P40), half of the PCPA-treated rats and half of the saline-treated rats began testosterone treatment (T, 5 mg/kg, 5 days/week). Behavioral measures included locomotion, irritability, copulation, mate preference, and aggression. The animals were tested for aggression in their home cage, with and without physical provocation (light tail pinching). Brain levels of 5-HT and its metabolite, 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid (5-HIAA), were determined by HPLC. PCPA significantly and substantially reduced 5-HT and 5-HIAA levels in all brain regions examined. Chronic T treatment significantly decreased 5-HT and 5-HIAA in some brain areas, but to a much lesser extent than PCPA. Chronic exposure to PCPA alone significantly decreased locomotor activity and increased irritability, but had no effect on sexual behavior, partner preference, or aggression. T alone had no effect on locomotion, irritability, or sexual behavior, but increased partner preference and aggression. The most striking effect of the combination of T+PCPA was a significant increase in attack frequency as well as a significant decrease in pre-attack latency, particularly following physical provocation. Based on these data, it can be hypothesized that pubertal AAS users with low central 5-HT levels might be particularly prone to exhibit aggressive behavior.\n",
      "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a complex polygenic and multifactorial disease, the etiopathology of which is still unclear, but several genetic factors have been shown to increase the risk of developing the disease. Purine nucleotides and nucleosides play an important role in the brain. In addition to their role in neurotransmission and neuromodulation, they are involved in the release of trophic factors, apoptosis and inflammatory responses. These mediators may also play a central role in the control of neurodegenerative processes associated with AD. In this report, the distribution of exonic G/A single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in the purine nucleoside phosphorylase (PNP) gene, resulting in the substitution of the amino acid serine with glycine at position 51 (G51S), was investigated in a large AD population. patients (n = 321) and non-demented controls (n = 208). The distribution of PNP polymorphism was not different between patients and controls. Polymorphism distribution was also analyzed in AD patients stratified by differential progressive rate of cognitive decline during 2-year follow-up. An increased representation of the PNP AA genotype was observed in AD patients with rapid cognitive deterioration compared to that in patients with a slow rate of deterioration. Our results suggest that the G51S PNP polymorphism is associated with a faster rate of cognitive decline in AD patients, highlighting the important role of purine metabolism in the progression of this neurodegenerative disorder.\n",
      "OBJECTIVES:The risk of acute myocardial infarction (AMI) with COX-2 inhibitors may offset their gastrointestinal (GI) benefit compared with non-selective nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) (NS). Our objective was to compare the risks of hospitalization for AMI and gastrointestinal bleeding in elderly patients using COX-2 inhibitors, NS-NSAIDs, and acetaminophen. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective cohort study using administrative data of patients aged > or = 65 years who filled a prescription for NSAIDs or acetaminophen between 1999 and 2002. Results were compared using of Cox regression models with time-dependent exposures. RESULTS: Person-years of exposure among non-aspirin users were: 75,761 to acetaminophen, 42,671 to rofecoxib, 65,860 to celecoxib, and 37,495 to NS-NSAIDs. Among aspirin users, they were: 14,671 on rofecoxib, 22,875 on celecoxib, 9,832 on NS-NSAIDs and 38,048 on acetaminophen. Among aspirin non-users, the adjusted hazard ratios (95% confidence interval) for AMI/GI hospitalization compared to the acetaminophen group (no aspirin) were: rofecoxib 1.27 (1.13, 1 .42), celecoxib 0.93 (0.83, 1.03), naproxen 1.59 (1.31, 1.93), diclofenac 1.17 (0.99, 1.38) and ibuprofen 1.05 (0.74, 1.51). Among aspirin users they were: rofecoxib 1.73 (1.52, 1.98), celecoxib 1.34 (1.19, 1.52), ibuprofen 1.51 (0.95, 2.41 ), diclofenac 1.69 (1.35, 2.10), naproxen 1.35 (0.97, 1.88) and acetaminophen 1.29 (1.17, 1.42). CONCLUSION: Among non-aspirin users, naproxen appeared to pose the highest risk of AMI/GI bleeding. The AMI/GI toxicity of celecoxib was similar to that of acetaminophen and appeared better than that of rofecoxib and NS-NSAIDs. Among aspirin users, celecoxib and naproxen appeared to be the least toxic.\n",
      "Eight Alu sequences (ACE, TPA25, PV92, APO, FXIIIB, D1, A25 and B65) were analyzed in two samples from the provinces of Navarra and Guipuzcoa (Basque Country, Spain). Alu data for other European, Caucasian, and North African populations were compiled from the literature for comparison to assess the genetic relationships of Basques in a broader geographic context. The results of the MDS plot and AMOVA revealed spatial heterogeneity between these three population groups clearly defined by geography. On the contrary, no substantial genetic heterogeneity was found between Basque samples, nor between Basques and other Europeans (excluding Caucasian populations). Furthermore, the genetic information obtained from Alu data conflicts with hypotheses linking the origin of the Basques to populations from North Africa (Berbers) or the Caucasus region (Georgia). To explain the reduced genetic heterogeneity detected by Alu insertions among Basque subpopulations, Wright's F(ST) statistic values ​​were estimated for Alu markers and a set of short tandem repeats ( STR) in terms of two geographical scales: (1) the Basque Country, (2) Europe (including the Basques). In the Basque region, Wahlund effect estimates for both genetic markers showed no statistical differences between Basque subpopulations. However, when this analysis was performed on a European scale, F(ST) values ​​were significantly higher for Alu insertions than for STR alleles. From these results, we suggest that the spatial heterogeneity of the Basque gene pool identified in previous studies on polymorphism is relatively recent and probably caused by a differential process of genetic admixture with neighboring non-Basque populations modulated by the effect from a language barrier to random mating. .\n",
      "There has been a reported case of severe malaria presenting with jaundice and experiencing arrhythmia (premature ventricular contraction) while receiving a quinine infusion. A 25-year-old man was admitted to hospital with high fever, chills, vomiting and jaundice. The patient was fully conscious, blood pressure 120/80 mmHg, pulse 100 x/minute, regular. On admission, laboratory examination showed Plasmodium falciparum (++++), total bilirubin 8.25 mg/dL, conjugated bilirubin 4.36 mg/dL, unconjugated bilirubin 3.89 mg/dL, potassium 3.52 meq/L. The patient was diagnosed as severe malaria with jaundice and given an infusion of quinine in dextrose 5% 500 mg/8 hours. On the second day, the patient experienced vomiting, diarrhea, tinnitus and hearing loss. After 30 hours of quinine infusion, the patient experienced palpitations and electrocardiographic (ECG) recording showed premature ventricular contraction (PVC) > 5 x/minute, trigemini, constant type - sinoatrial block, wave U positive. He was treated with 50 mg of lidocaine intravenously followed by an infusion of 1,500 mg in 5% dextrose/24 hours and one potassium aspartate tablet. The quinine infusion was stopped and replaced with quinine sulfate tablets. Three hours later the patient felt better, the PVC frequency was reduced to 4 - 5 x/minute and on the third day the ECG was normal, the potassium level was 3.34 meq/L. It came out on the 7th day in good condition. Quinine, like quinidine, is a chincona alkaloid that has antiarrhythmic properties, although it is also proarrhythmic and can cause various arrhythmias, including serious arrhythmias such as multiple PVCs. Administration of parenteral quinine should be carried out with caution and careful monitoring due to its pro-arrhythmic effect, particularly in elderly patients with cardiac diseases or in patients with an electrolyte disturbance (hypokalemia) which frequently occurs due to vomiting and/or diarrhea in cases of malaria.\n",
      "We report cytogenetic and molecular studies of a de novo, apparently balanced t(1;3)(q32.1;q25.1) identified in a 12-year-old female (designated DGAP128) presenting with cerebral atrophy, seizures of macrocephaly and developmental disorders. delay. A combination of fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) and Southern blot analysis demonstrated disruption of a synaptotagmin gene (SYT14) at breakpoint 1q32. The expression of SYT14 in human brain was confirmed by Northern analysis. Because members of the synaptotagmin family of proteins function as sensors that link changes in calcium levels to various biological processes, including neurotransmission and hormonal responsiveness, SYT14 is an intriguing candidate gene for this child's abnormal development. This is the first known constitutional rearrangement of SYT14, and systematic genetic analyzes and further clinical studies of DGAP128 may offer unique insights into the role of SYT14 in neurodevelopment.\n",
      "BACKGROUND: Methadone is prescribed to heroin addicts to reduce illicit opioid use. Prolongation of the QT interval in the ECG of patients with torsade de pointes (TdP) has been reported in methadone users. Because heroin addicts sometimes pass out while using illicit drugs, doctors might attribute too many syncope episodes to illicit drug use and thus underestimate the incidence of TdP in this particular population, and the high mortality in this population. population could, in part, be caused by the proarrhythmic effect of methadone. METHODS: In this cross-sectional study, ECGs and blood samples were collected from a population of adult heroin addicts treated daily with methadone or buprenorphine. Of the patients at the Copenhagen Municipality drug addiction service, 450 (approximately 52%) were included. The QT interval was estimated from 12 lead ECGs. All participants were asked about any experiences of syncope. The association between opioid dose and QT interval, as well as methadone dose and report of syncope was evaluated by multivariate linear regression and logistic regression, respectively. RESULTS: Methadone dose was associated with a 0.140 ms/mg longer QT interval (p = 0.002). No association between buprenorphine and QTc interval was found. Among methadone-treated subjects, 28% of men and 32% of women had a prolonged QTc interval. None of the subjects treated with buprenorphine had a QTc interval > 0.440 s ((1/2)). A higher methadone dose of 50 mg was associated with a 1.2 (95% CI: 1.1 to 1.4) times increased risk of syncope. CONCLUSIONS: Methadone is associated with QT prolongation and a higher rate of syncope in a heroin-dependent population.\n",
      "Bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs) are a highly conserved class of signaling molecules that induce ectopic cartilage and bone formation in vivo. Dysregulated expression of bone morphogenetic protein 4 (BMP4) is found in cells from patients with fibrodysplasia ossificans progressiva (FOP), a genetic disorder of axial and appendicular skeletal malformation and progressive heterotopic ossification. Loss-of-function mutations in the bone morphogenetic protein 5 (bmp5) gene leading to underexpression of BMP5 cause murine short ear syndrome, characterized by small, malformed ears and a wide range of axial skeletal malformations . We found features reminiscent of both mouse short ear and FOP in a child with malformed external ears, multiple axial skeletal malformations, and progressive heterotopic ossification of the neck and back. We examined BMP mRNA expression in transformed lymphocytes by semiquantitative RT-PCR and protein expression by ELISA and immunohistochemistry. High levels of BMP4 and BMP5 mRNA and protein were detected in the patient's cells, while BMP2 mRNA levels remained unchanged. Our data suggest that deregulated expression of BMP4 and BMP5 genes is associated with a set of human axial skeletal abnormalities similar to those in short-eared mice and FOP.\n",
      "To identify genetic variants contributing to end-stage renal disease (ESRD) in type 2 diabetes, we performed a genome-wide analysis of 115,352 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in groups of 105 unrelated cases with of ESRD and 102 unrelated control subjects who had suffered from type 2 diabetes for > or = 10 years without macroalbuminuria. Using a sliding window statistic of ranked SNPs, we identified a 200 kb region on 8q24 harboring three SNPs with substantial differences in allele frequency between the case and control pools. These SNPs were genotyped in individuals comprising each pool, and strong evidence of association was found with rs2720709 (P = 0.000021; odds ratio 2.57 [95% CI 1.66-3.96] ), which is located in the plasmacytoma variant translocation gene PVT1. We sequenced all exons, exon-intron boundaries, and the promoter of PVT1 and identified 47 variants, 11 of which represented non-redundant markers with a minor allele frequency > or = 0.05. We then genotyped these 11 variants along with 87 additional SNPs identified in public databases in the adjacent 319 kb rs2720709 (approximately 1 SNP/3.5 kb); 23 markers were associated with ESRD at P < 0.01. The strongest evidence of association was found for rs2648875 (P = 0.0000018; 2.97 [1.90-4.65]), which corresponds to intron 8 of PVT1. Together, these results suggest that PVT1 may contribute to susceptibility to ESRD in diabetes.\n",
      "BACKGROUND: Electrocardiography has very low sensitivity for detecting dobutamine-induced myocardial ischemia. OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the added diagnostic value of a new measure of cardiac performance index (dP/dtejc), based on changes in brachial artery flow, compared to standard 12-lead ECG, to detect dobutamine-induced myocardial ischemia, using simple Tc99m-Sestamibi. -photon emission computed tomography as a reference for comparison to assess the presence or absence of ischemia. METHODS: The study group included 40 patients undergoing Sestamibi-SPECT/dobutamine stress testing. Simultaneous measurements of ECG and brachial artery dP/dtejc were performed at each dobutamine level. In 19 of 40 patients, perfusion defects consistent with ischemia were detected by SPECT. The increase in dP/dtejc level during dobutamine infusion in this group was severely impaired compared to the nonischemic group. The dP/dtejc result was combined with the ECG results, giving an ECG-enhanced value, and compared to the ECG alone. RESULTS: Sensitivity improved significantly from 16% to 79%, positive predictive value increased from 60% to 68% and negative predictive value from 54% to 78%, and specificity decreased from 90% to 67%. %. CONCLUSIONS: If ECG alone is used for specificity, the combination with dP/dtejc improved the sensitivity of the test and could provide a cost-effective alternative to cardiac imaging or perfusion studies to detect myocardial ischemia, in particularly in patients unable to exercise.\n",
      "Van der Woude syndrome (VWS) is the most common type of orofacial syndromic cleft, accounting for approximately 2% of all cases of cleft lip and palate. It is characterized by a variable association of lower lip hollows, cleft lip and palate and hypodontia. VWS results from mutations in the gene encoding interferon regulatory factor 6 (IRF6). The disease is transmitted in an autosomal dominant manner, with high penetrance and variable expressivity. Very recently, mutations in the IRF6 gene in exons 2 to 9 were discovered in patients with VWS, suggesting that this gene plays an important role in orofacial development. We report a novel mutation of the IRF6 gene in a German family. Five of the 12 people concerned were able to be investigated. The mutation produced a stop codon in exon 4 of the IRF6 gene. All 5 patients were heterozygous for a c.201C>A base substitution changing the tyrosine codon at amino acid position 67 to a stop codon (p.Y67X) in exon 4. The premature stop codon was responsible for a truncated protein lacking parts of the DNA-binding domain and the complete Smad interferon regulatory factor-binding domain are likely essential for interactions with Smad transcription factors.\n",
      "BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES:A number of antibodies against microbial epitopes or self-antigens have been associated with Crohn's disease. The development of antibodies reflects a loss of tolerance to the gut bacteria that cause Crohn's disease, leading to an exaggerated adaptive immune response to these bacteria. It has been hypothesized that the development of antimicrobial antibodies is influenced by the presence of genetic variants in pattern recognition receptor genes. The aim of this study was therefore to investigate the influence of mutations in these innate immune receptor genes (nucleotide oligomerization domain (NOD) 2/caspase recruitment domain (CARD) 15, NOD1/CARD4, TUCAN/ CARDINAL/CARD8, Toll-like receptor (TLR) 4, TLR2, TLR1 and TLR6) on the development of antimicrobial and antiglycan antibodies in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Materials and Methods: A cohort of 1,163 unrelated IBD patients (874 Crohn's disease, 259 ulcerative colitis, 30 indeterminate colitis) and 312 controls were analyzed for anti-Saccharomyces cerevisiae (gASCA) IgG antibodies, anti-Saccharomyces cerevisiae (gASCA) IgG antibodies, -laminaribioside (ALCA) IgG, anti-chitobioside (ACCA) IgA, anti-mannobioside (AMCA) IgG and outer membrane porin (Omp) IgA and were genotyped for NOD2/CARD15, TUCAN variants /CARDINAL/CARD8, NOD1/CARD4, TLR4, TLR1, TLR2 and TLR6. RESULTS: Compared to Crohn's disease patients without CARD15 mutations, the presence of at least one CARD15 variant in Crohn's disease patients more frequently led to gASCA positivity (66.1% vs. 51.5 %, p < 0.0001) and ALCA positivity (43.3% versus 34.9%). , p = 0.018) and higher gASCA titers (85.7 versus 51.8 ELISA units, p < 0.0001), independently of ileal involvement. A gene dosage effect, with increasing positivity of gASCA and ALCA for patients carrying none, one and two CARD15 variants, respectively, was observed for both markers. Similarly, Crohn's disease patients carrying the NOD1/CARD4 indel had a higher prevalence of gASCA antibodies than wild-type patients (63.8% vs. 55.2%, p = 0.014), also with a gene dosage effect. An opposite effect was observed for the TLR4 D299G and TLR2 P631H variants, with a lower prevalence of ACCA antibodies (23.4% versus 35%, p = 0.013) and Omp antibodies (20.5% versus 34.6% , p = 0.009), respectively. CONCLUSION:Variants in innate immune receptor genes influence the formation of antibodies against microbial epitopes. In this regard, it is curious that an opposite effect of CARD15 and TLR4 variants was observed. These results could contribute to the understanding of the etiology of seroreactivity observed in IBD.\n",
      "To develop a novel and effective drug that could improve cognitive function and neuroprotection, we recently synthesized maltolyl p-coumarate by esterification of maltol and p-coumaric acid. In the present study, we examined whether maltolyl p-coumarate could ameliorate cognitive decline in scopolamine-injected rats and in beta-amyloid peptide-infused rats (1-42). Maltolyl p-coumarate was found to attenuate cognitive deficits in both rat models using a passive avoidance test and reduced apoptotic cell death observed in the hippocampus of beta peptide-infused rats. -amyloid (1-42). We also examined the neuroprotective effects of maltolyl p-coumarate in vitro using SH-SY5Y cells. Cells were pretreated with maltolyl p-coumarate, before being exposed to beta-amyloid peptide (1-42), glutamate or H2O2. We found that maltolyl p-coumarate significantly decreased apoptotic cell death and reduced reactive oxygen species, cytochrome c release, and caspase 3 activation. Pooling these in vitro and in vivo results, our study suggests that maltolyl p-coumarate is a potentially effective candidate against Alzheimer's disease characterized by widespread neuronal death and progressive decline in cognitive function.\n",
      "Polymorphism of the manganese superoxide dismutase (Mn-SOD) gene is a novel approach to identify its probable association with urolithiasis. Oxidative stress may be involved in the development of stone formation in the renal system. MnSOD is one of the main enzymes that directly remove potentially harmful oxidative species. A substitution of valine (Val) for alanine (Ala) at amino acid 16, occurring in the mitochondrial targeting sequence of the MnSOD gene, has been associated with an increased risk of urolithiasis. This study was conducted to investigate the association of MnSOD gene polymorphism with the risk of urolithiasis. We studied MnSOD in 66 stone-forming adults and 72 healthy volunteers. DNA was isolated from peripheral blood and genotyping was performed using PCR-based methods. Then, the PCR products were cut by BsaW1. The products were analyzed on a 3% agarose gel, the 246 bp regions were 1-Ala-9, the 164 and 82 bp products were determined to be 2 Val-9. The Chi-square test was used for comparison between patients and controls. In the control group, the homozygous Ala allele was significantly higher than in the patient group (P < 0.01). The distribution of Ala/Val and homozygous Val alleles in the patient group was significantly higher than in the control group (P < 0.05). Determination of the MnSOD genotype may provide a tool to identify individuals at risk for urolithiasis. This experiment also provides data on antioxidant status and stone formation.\n",
      "PURPOSE: Breast cancer prognosis varies widely among individuals, and inherited genetic factors may help explain this variability. Genes involved in defense against reactive oxygen species (ROS) are of particular interest, as ROS are thought to cause DNA damage and contribute to cancer pathogenesis. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We examined associations between 54 polymorphisms that mark known common variants (minor allele frequency > 0.05) in 10 genes involved in oxidative damage repair (CAT, SOD1, SOD2, GPX1, GPX4, GSR , TXN, TXN2, TXNRD1, and TXNRD2) and survival in 4,470 women with of breast cancer. RESULTS: Two single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in GPX4 (rs713041 and rs757229) were associated with all-cause mortality, even after adjustment for testing multiple hypotheses (adjusted P = 0.0041 and P = 0.0035). These SNPs are correlated with each other (r2 = 0.61). GPX4 rs713041 is located near the selenocysteine ​​insertion sequence element in the 3' untranslated region of GPX4, and the rare allele of this SNP is associated with an increased risk of death, with a relative risk of 1 .27 per rare allele carried (95% CI, 1.13). at 11:43 a.m.). This effect was not attenuated after adjusting for tumor stage, grade, or estrogen receptor status. We found that the common allele is preferentially expressed in normal lymphocytes, normal breast, and breast tumors compared to the rare allele, but there was no difference in total GPX4 mRNA levels according to genotypes. CONCLUSION: These data strongly support the hypothesis that a common variation in GPX4 is associated with prognosis after breast cancer diagnosis.\n",
      "Mutations in the GJB2 gene are the most common cause of hereditary prelingual sensorineural hearing loss in Europe. Several studies indicate that different members of the connexin protein family interact to form gap junctions in the inner ear. Mutations in different connexin genes can accumulate and consequently lead to hearing loss. Therefore, we examined 47 Hungarian GJB2 heterozygous (a mutation in the coding exon of the GJB2 gene) patients with hearing loss for DNA changes in two other connexin genes (GJB6 and GJB3) and in the region non-coding 5' of GJB2, including splice sites. Eleven of the 47 GJB2 heterozygous patients analyzed carried the -3170G>A splice site mutation in the 5'UTR region of GJB2. One of these 11 patients presented a homozygous genotype -3170G>A in association with p.R127H. Alongside the GJB2 mutations, we noted 2 cases of deletion in GJB6 [Delta(GJB6-D13S1830)] and 3 base substitutions (2 new and 1 described) in GJB3 [c.357C>T, c.798C>T and c.94C >T (p.R32W)] which are unlikely to cause disease. Our results suggest the importance of systematic screening for the -3170G>A mutation, which is rather common (in addition to c.35delG) in hearing-impaired patients.\n",
      "Achondroplasia is the most common form of dwarfism and has an incidence of approximately 1/7,500. In more than 98% of cases, the disease is associated with a G to A or G to C substitution at nucleotide position 1138 (p.G380R) of the fibroblast growth factor receptor 3 (FGFR3) gene. We have developed a sensitive single-tube tetra-primer PCR assay to detect both the c.1138G>A and c.1138G>C mutations and can successfully distinguish between DNA samples homozygous and heterozygous for the c.1138G mutation. >A. Titration studies showed that the assay could reliably detect one copy of the mutant allele in a mixture of 100 wild-type alleles. The test was tested in 50 healthy controls, 3 known patients with achondroplasia and 5 amniotic fluids suspected of achondroplasia and for whom we had previously determined the genotypes of the c.1138G>A mutation by PCR-RFLP. We observed complete agreement between the methods. Our tetra-primer PCR assay is a sensitive, inexpensive and easy-to-use method for FGFR3 p.G380R genotyping, which could be used even in “low-tech” laboratories.\n",
      "This was an exploratory study to investigate lamivudine-resistant hepatitis B virus (HBV) strains in selected lamivudine-naïve HBV carriers with and without human immunodeficiency virus co-infection (HIV) in South African patients. Thirty-five lamivudine-naïve HBV-infected patients, with or without HIV co-infection, were studied: 15 chronic HBV mono-infected patients and 20 HBV-HIV co-infected patients. This latter group was subdivided into 13 patients with occult HBV (HBsAg negative) and 7 patients obviously infected with HBV (HBsAg positive). HBsAg, anti-HBs, anti-HBc, and anti-HIV 1/2 were determined as part of routine diagnosis using Axsym assays (Abbott Laboratories, North Chicago, IL). Serum samples were amplified by PCR with HBV reverse transcriptase (RT) primers, followed by direct sequencing through the tyrosine-methionine-aspartate-aspartate (YMDD) motif of the major catalytic region of the C domain of the HBV RT enzyme. HBV viral load was performed with the Amplicor HBV Monitor v2.0 test (Roche Diagnostics, Penzberg, Germany). Lamivudine-resistant HBV strains were detected in 3 of 15 mono-infected chronic hepatitis B patients and 10 of 20 patients co-infected with HBV and HIV. To our knowledge, this is the first report of lamivudine-resistant HBV strains in treatment-naïve HBV-HIV co-infected patients. HBV viral loads in mono-infected and co-infected patients ranged from 3.32 x 10(2) to 3.82 x 10(7) and <200 to 4.40 x 10(3) copies/ml, respectively. . It remains to be seen whether such pre-existing antiviral mutations could lead to the widespread emergence of HBV-resistant strains when lamivudine-containing highly active antiretroviral (ARV) regimens (HAART) become widely implemented in South Africa, as this may have potential implications in the management of HBV-HIV co-infected patients.\n",
      "People with HIV can now live long lives thanks to drug treatment that often includes protease inhibitors such as ritonavir. However, many patients develop long-term negative side effects, such as premature atherosclerosis. We have previously demonstrated that ritonavir treatment increases atherosclerotic lesion formation in male mice more than in female mice. Additionally, peripheral blood monocytes isolated from ritonavir-treated females showed less accumulation of cholesteryl esters. In the present study, we investigated the molecular mechanisms by which female hormones influence cholesterol metabolism in macrophages in response to ritonavir, an HIV protease inhibitor. We used the human monocytic cell line THP-1 as a model to answer this question. Briefly, cells were differentiated for 72 h with 100 nM PMA to obtain a macrophage-like phenotype in the presence or absence of 1 nM 17beta-estradiol (E2), 100 nM progesterone, or vehicle (0 .01% ethanol). Cells were then treated with 30 ng/ml ritonavir or vehicle in the presence of aggregated LDL for 24 h. Cell extracts were harvested and lipid or total RNA was isolated. E2 decreased cholesteryl ester accumulation in macrophages after ritonavir treatment. Ritonavir increased the expression of the scavenger receptor, CD36 mRNA, which is responsible for LDL uptake. Additionally, ritonavir treatment selectively increased the relative mRNA levels of PPARgamma, a transcription factor responsible for regulating CD36 mRNA expression. Treatment with E2, however, failed to prevent these increases at the mRNA level. E2, however, significantly suppressed CD36 protein levels measured by fluorescent immunocytochemistry. These data suggest that E2 alters CD36 expression at the level of protein expression in monocyte-derived macrophages, resulting in reduced cholesteryl ester accumulation after ritonavir treatment.\n",
      "PAX9 and MSX1 are transcription factors that play essential roles in craniofacial and limb development. In humans, mutations in both genes are associated with non-syndromic and syndromic oligodontia, respectively. We examined a family with nonsyndromic oligodontia for mutations in PAX9 and MSX1. Single-strand conformational polymorphism (SSCP) analysis and sequencing revealed a novel C139T heterozygous transition in PAX9 in affected family members. No mutations were detected in the entire MSX1 coding sequence. The C139T mutation, which is predicted to result in the substitution of an arginine for a tryptophan (R47W) in the N-terminal subdomain, affected conserved residues in the PAX9 paired domain. To elucidate the pathogenic mechanism producing the oligodontia phenotype caused by this mutation, we analyzed the binding of wild-type and mutant PAX9 paired domain protein to double-stranded DNA targets. The R47W mutation significantly reduced DNA binding, suggesting that the mutant protein, with consequent haploinsufficiency, results in a clinical phenotype.\n",
      "BACKGROUND:Focal cutaneous hypoplasia (FDH) (OMIM 305600) is an X-linked dominant disorder of ecto-mesodermal development. Also known as Goltz syndrome, FDH presents with characteristic linear striations of the hypoplastic dermis and variable abnormalities of the bones, nails, hair, limbs, teeth, and eyes. The molecular basis of FDH involves mutations in the PORCN gene, which encodes an enzyme enabling membrane targeting and secretion of several Wnt proteins essential for normal tissue development. OBJECTIVES: To investigate the molecular basis of FDH in a 2-year-old Thai girl who presented at birth with pale, depressed linear scars on the trunk and limbs, thinning and brittle hair, syndactyly of the right middle finger and of the ring finger, dental caries and radiological characteristics of striatal osteopathy. METHODS: Sequencing genomic DNA from the affected individual and both parents to search for disease-causing mutations in the PORCN gene. RESULTS: DNA sequencing revealed a heterozygous G>T substitution at nucleotide c.898 in exon 10 (NM_203475.1), converting a glutamic acid (GAA) residue to a premature termination codon (TAA ). This mutation, called p.E300X, was not detected in the DNA of either parent or in 100 control chromosomes. CONCLUSION: The identification of this novel de novo nonsense mutation confirms the diagnosis of FDH in this child and highlights the clinical importance of the PORCN and Wnt signaling pathways in embryogenesis.\n",
      "BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Methylating agents are effective chemotherapy agents for Hodgkin lymphoma, but are associated with the development of second primary cancers. The cytotoxicity of methylating agents is mainly mediated by the DNA mismatch repair (MMR) system. Loss of MLH1, a major component of MMR DNA, results in tolerance to the cytotoxic effects of methylating agents and the persistence of mutagenized cells at high risk of malignant transformation. We hypothesized that a common substitution in the basal promoter of MLH1 (position -93, rs1800734) modifies cancer risk after methylating chemotherapy. METHODS: 133 patients who developed cancer following chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy (n = 133), 420 patients diagnosed with de novo myeloid leukemia, 242 patients diagnosed with primary Hodgkin lymphoma and 1177 healthy controls were genotyped for the MLH1 -93 polymorphism by allelic. polymerase chain reaction (PCR) discrimination and restriction fragment length polymorphism testing. Odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals for cancer risk based on MLH1 -93 polymorphism status, and stratified by prior exposure to methylating chemotherapy, were calculated using an unconditional logistic regression. RESULTS: The frequency of MLH1 -93 variant carriers was higher in patients who developed treatment-related acute myeloid leukemia (t-AML) (75.0%, n = 12) or breast cancer (53.3 % n = 15) after methylation chemotherapy for Hodgkin. lymphoma compared to patients without prior methylation exposure (t-AML, 30.4%, n = 69; breast cancer patients, 27.2%, n = 22). The MLH1 -93 variant allele was also overrepresented in t-AML cases compared to de novo AML cases (36.9%, n=420) and healthy controls (36.3%, n=952), and was associated with a significantly increased risk of developing T-AML (odds ratio 5.31, 95% confidence interval 1.40 to 20.15), but only in patients previously treated with a methylating agent. CONCLUSIONS: These data support the hypothesis that the common polymorphism at position -93 in the MLH1 core promoter defines a risk allele for cancer development after methylating chemotherapy for Hodgkin lymphoma. However, it is suggested to replicate these results in larger studies.\n",
      "PURPOSE: A randomized, double-blind study to compare the gastrointestinal (GI) tolerability, safety and efficacy of etoricoxib and diclofenac in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Patients and Methods: A total of 4,086 patients (mean age 60.8 years) diagnosed with RA were enrolled and received 90 mg of etoricoxib daily (n = 2,032) or 75 mg of diclofenac twice daily ( n = 2,054). The use of gastroprotective agents and low-dose aspirin was permitted. The prespecified primary endpoint was the cumulative rate of patient withdrawals due to clinical and laboratory gastrointestinal adverse events (AEs). Overall safety was also assessed, including data on thrombotic cardiovascular events assessed. Efficacy was assessed using the Patient Global Assessment of Disease Status (PGADS; 0–4 point scale). RESULTS: The mean (SD; maximum) treatment duration was 19.3 (10.3; 32.9) and 19.1 (10.4; 33.1) months in the etoricoxib and diclofenac groups, respectively. The cumulative discontinuation rate due to gastrointestinal AEs was significantly lower with etoricoxib than with diclofenac (5.2 versus 8.5 events per 100 patient years, respectively; relative risk 0.62 (CI 95%: 0.47, 0.81; p < or = 0.001)). The incidence of discontinuations for hypertension- and edema-related AEs was significantly higher with etoricoxib (2.5% and 1.1%, respectively) than with diclofenac (1.5% and 0. 4% respectively; p<0.001 for hypertension and p<0.01 for edema). Treatment with etoricoxib and diclofenac resulted in similar efficacy (mean PGADS changes from baseline -0.62 versus -0.58, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: Etoricoxib 90 mg demonstrated a significantly lower risk of treatment discontinuation due to gastrointestinal AEs compared to diclofenac 150 mg. Discontinuations due to renovascular AEs, although less frequent than discontinuations due to GI AEs, were significantly higher with etoricoxib.\n",
      "INTRODUCTION: The possible anxiogenic effects of fluoroquinolones, namely ciprofloxacin and norfloxacin, were studied in adult Charles Foster albino rats of both sexes, weighing between 150 and 200 g. METHODS: The drugs were administered orally, at doses of 50 mg/kg for five consecutive days and the experiments were carried out on the fifth day. Tests included open-field exploratory behavior, high plus maze and high zero maze, social interaction, and novelty suppressed food latency behavior. RESULTS: Results indicate that rats treated with ciprofloxacin and norfloxacin showed anxiety-like behavior compared to control rats for all parameters studied. However, rats treated with ciprofloxacin and norfloxacin did not differ significantly from each other in various behavioral parameters. CONCLUSION: The present experimental results confirm the clinically observed anxiogenic potential of ciprofloxacin and norfloxacin.\n",
      "BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES: Lipoprotein glomerulopathy (LPG) is a rare disease characterized by thrombus-like substances in markedly dilated glomerular capillaries and elevated plasma levels of apolipoprotein E (apoE). Previous studies have shown that genetic disorders of apoE may contribute to the pathogenesis of LPG, but LPG may not be caused by mutations in the apoE gene in Chinese patients. This study investigated the association of a novel apoE variant with LPG in a Chinese family. METHODS: The apoE gene in a family of 4 LPG patients was sequenced. The polymerase chain reaction product of the apoE exon 4 coding region was cloned into the pMD 18-T vector and then sequenced. RESULTS: A novel point mutation in exon 4 of the apoE gene was identified in all 4 LPG patients and 1 asymptomatic family member. Sequence analysis confirmed a point mutation from nucleotide G to C in exon 4 (base 308) of the apoE gene in all patients and the asymptomatic family member. This missense mutation denotes the amino acid substitution of the proline residue by the arginine residue at position 150 of apoE. These patients were all heterozygous with apoE Guangzhou. One of the two grandsons was a heterozygous carrier of apoE Guangzhou, although he did not suffer from proteinuria. CONCLUSION: The results of this study suggest that apoE (arginine 150 proline) is a new variant of apoE etiologically linked to LPG. This variant (apoE Guangzhou) can cause a marked molecular conformational change in apoE and thus impair its lipid-binding capacity.\n",
      "PURPOSE: Childhood systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) presents a unique subgroup of patients for genetic study. The present study was undertaken to identify susceptibility genes contributing to SLE, using a novel candidate gene pathway microarray platform to study gene expression in patients with SLE since childhood and in their two parents. METHODS: Using bioinformatics tools, a platform of 9,412 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) from 1,204 genes was designed and validated. Molecular inversion probes and high-throughput SNP technologies were used for assay development. Seven hundred and fifty-three subjects, corresponding to 251 complete trios of childhood-onset SLE families, were genotyped and analyzed using transmission disequilibrium testing (TDT) and multitest corrections. RESULTS: Familial TDT showed a significant association of SLE with an N673S polymorphism in the P-selectin gene (SELP) (P = 5.74 x 10(-6)) and a C203S polymorphism in receptor-associated kinase 1 of interleukin-1. gene (IRAK1) (P = 9.58 x 10 (-6)). These 2 SNPs had a false discovery rate for multitest correction <0.05, and therefore a >95% probability of being considered proven. Additionally, 7 additional SNPs had q values ​​<0.5, suggesting an association with SLE and providing direction for follow-up studies. These additional genes notably included TNFRSF6 (Fas) and IRF5, supporting previous findings on their association with SLE pathogenesis. CONCLUSION:SELP and IRAK1 were identified as novel SLE-associated genes with a high degree of importance, suggesting new directions in understanding SLE pathogenesis. The overall design and results of this study demonstrate that the candidate microarray platform used provides a novel and powerful approach that is generally applicable for identifying the genetic underpinnings of complex diseases.\n",
      "BACKGROUND: In addition to blocking nociceptive input to surgical sites, long-acting local anesthetics could directly modulate inflammation. In the present study, we describe the proinflammatory effects of bupivacaine on local prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) production and cyclooxygenase (COX) gene expression that increase postoperative pain in human subjects. METHODS: Subjects (n=114) undergoing extraction of impacted third molars received either 2% lidocaine or 0.5% bupivacaine before surgery and either rofecoxib 50 mg or placebo orally 90 minutes before surgery and for the next 48 hours. Oral mucosal biopsies were taken before surgery and 48 hours after surgery. After extraction, a microdialysis probe was placed at the surgical site for PGE2 and thromboxane B2 (TXB2) measurements. RESULTS: The bupivacaine/rofecoxib group reported significantly less pain, assessed by a visual analog scale, compared to the other three treatment groups during the first 4 hours. However, the bupivacaine/placebo group reported significantly higher pain after 24 hours and PGE2 levels during the first 4 hours were significantly higher than the other three treatment groups. Additionally, bupivacaine significantly increased COX-2 gene expression after 48 hours compared to the lidocaine/placebo group. Thromboxane levels were not significantly affected by any of the treatments, indicating that the observed effects were attributable to inhibition of COX-2, but not COX-1. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that bupivacaine stimulates COX-2 gene expression after tissue injury, which is associated with higher PGE2 production and pain after the local anesthetic effect wears off.\n",
      "OBJECTIVE:The aim of this study was to determine whether mutations in meiotic genes, such as disrupted meiotic cDNA (DMC1), MutS homolog (MSH4), MSH5, and S. cerevisiae homolog (SPO11), were associated with premature ovarian failure (POF). ). DESIGN: Case-control study. METHODS: Blood samples, karyotype, hormonal assay, ultrasound and ovarian biopsy were performed on most patients. However, the primary outcome was genomic DNA sequencing from peripheral blood samples from 41 women with POF and 36 fertile women (controls). RESULTS: A single heterozygous missense mutation, substitution of a cytosine residue for thymidine in exon 2 of MSH5, was found in two Caucasian women in whom POF developed at ages 18 and 36 years . This mutation resulted in the replacement of a non-polar amino acid (proline) with a polar amino acid (serine) at position 29 (P29S). Neither 36 control women nor 39 other POF patients possessed this genetic disruption. Another POF patient of African origin presented a homozygous nucleotide change in the tenth of the DMC1 gene that led to an alteration in the amino acid composition of the protein (M200V). CONCLUSIONS: The infertility symptoms observed in the carrier of the homozygous DMC1 mutation and in the two patients with a heterozygous substitution in exon 2 of the MSH5 gene provide indirect evidence of the role of genes involved in meiotic recombination in the regulation of ovarian function. MSH5 and DMC1 mutations may be an explanation for POF, although rare.\n",
      "Multiple pterygium syndromes (MPS) include a group of multiple birth defects characterized by webbing (pterygia) of the neck, elbows, and/or knees and joint contractures (arthrogryposis). MPS are phenotypically and genetically heterogeneous, but are traditionally divided into lethal and nonfatal prenatal types (Escobar). Previously, we and others reported that recessive mutations in the g subunit of the embryonic acetylcholine receptor (CHRNG) can cause both fatal and nonfatal MPS, demonstrating that pterygia results from fetal akinesia. We hypothesized that mutations in acetylcholine receptor-related genes might also result in an MPS/fetal akinesia phenotype and therefore analyzed 15 cases of fatal MPS/fetal akinesia without CHRNG mutations for mutations in CHRNA1, CHRNB1, CHRND and rapsyn (RAPSN). Genoa. No CHRNA1, CHRNB1, or CHRND mutations were detected, but a homozygous RAPSN frameshift mutation, c.1177-1178delAA, was identified in a family of three children with fatal fetal akinesia sequence. Previously, RAPSN mutations have been reported in congenital myasthenia gravis. Functional studies were consistent with the hypothesis that although incomplete loss of rapsyn function can cause congenital myasthenia gravis, more severe loss of function can result in a lethal fetal akinesia phenotype.\n",
      "BACKGROUND: Afro-Caribbeans in Tobago are at high risk of developing prostate cancer. This elevated risk of prostate cancer is shared by populations of African descent living in various environments across the Western Hemisphere. It was recently reported that variation in the ribonuclease L (RNASEL) gene was associated with increased risk of prostate cancer. However, it is not yet known whether variation in RNASEL contributes to the increased risk of prostate cancer observed in populations of African ancestry. METHODS: We resequenced the positional candidate gene RNASEL in 48 prostate cancer cases and genotyped the previously reported R462Q and D541E polymorphisms in 230 prostate cancer cases and 458 controls. We also examined RNASEL (ABCE1) inhibitor to determine variation associated with prostate cancer risk. RESULTS: We found no evidence of association between R462Q and D541E polymorphisms and prostate cancer risk in our case-control analysis. A new variant (K294E) was identified in a single heterozygous individual with prostate cancer. We also observed a 20 bp insertion/deletion polymorphism, 1109 bp upstream of the start codon, but this variant was not associated with prostate cancer. We identified 16 single-nucleotide polymorphisms in the ABCE1 gene, of which only 3 had a minor allele frequency >5%. A common A/G transition of -1071 bp from the transcription start site was genotyped and showed no evidence of association with prostate cancer. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that common variation in the putative prostate cancer susceptibility gene, RNASEL, or its inhibitor does not contribute significantly to prostate cancer risk in this Afro-Caribbean population.\n",
      "We have previously shown that, in primary sheep pituitary cells, bone morphogenetic protein (BMP)-4 inhibits FSHbeta mRNA expression and FSH release. In contrast, in mouse LbetaT2 gonadotrophs, others showed a stimulatory effect of BMPs on basal or FSHbeta promoter-stimulated transcription. As a species comparison with our previous results, we used LbetaT2 cells to study the effects of BMP-4 on gonadotropin mRNA and modulated activin and GnRH secretion. BMP-4 alone had no effect on FSH production, but enhanced activin + GnRH-induced stimulation of FSHbeta mRNA and FSH secretion, without any effect on FSH mRNA. follistatin. BMP-4 reduced LHbeta mRNA upregulation in response to GnRH (+/-activin) and decreased GnRH receptor expression, which would promote FSH synthesis and secretion , rather than LH. Unlike sheep pituitary gonadotrophs, which only express BMP receptors types IA (BMPRIA) and II (BMPRII), LbetaT2 cells also express BMPRIB. BMP-4-induced Smad1/5 phosphorylation, indicating activation of BMP signaling, was the same whether BMP-4 was used alone or combined with activin+/-GnRH. We hypothesized that activin and/or GnRH pathways might be modulated by BMP-4, but neither activin-stimulated Smad2/3 phosphorylation nor response element-binding phosphorylation ERK1/2 or GnRH-induced cAMP were not altered. However, GnRH-induced p38 MAPK activation was decreased by BMP-4. This was associated with increased FSHbeta mRNA levels and FSH secretion, but decreased LHbeta mRNA levels. These results support 1. BMPs as important modulators of activin- and/or GnRH-stimulated gonadotropin synthesis and release and 2. important species differences in these effects, which could be related to differences in BMP receptor expression in gonadotrophs.\n",
      "Amikacin is an aminoglycoside commonly used to provide empiric double Gram-negative treatment for febrile neutropenia and other suspected infections. Both extended interval and conventional dosing strategies have been widely used in the general medical population; however, data are lacking to support a dosing strategy in the hematology/oncology population. To evaluate amikacin-associated nephrotoxicity in an adult hematology/oncology population, a prospective, randomized, open-label trial was conducted at a university-affiliated medical center. Forty patients with a diagnosis consistent with a hematologic/oncologic disorder requiring aminoglycoside therapy were randomized to receive conventional or extended-interval amikacin. The occurrence of nephrotoxicity through increased serum creatinine and assessment of efficacy via serum concentrations of amikacin with the respective pathogens were assessed. The occurrence of nephrotoxicity was similar between the conventional and extended interval groups, at 10% and 5%, respectively (P = 1.00). Six patients in the conventional group had a positive culture, compared with none in the extended interval group (P = 0.002). The occurrence of nephrotoxicity was similar between the two dosing regimens, but the distribution of risk factors was variable between the two groups. The effectiveness could not be evaluated.\n",
      "BACKGROUND: Fumarate hydratase (HGNC approved gene symbol - FH), also known as fumarase, is an enzyme of the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle, involved in fundamental cellular energy production. First described by Zinn et al. in 1986, FH deficiency led to severe and early encephalopathy. In 2002, the Multiple Leiomyoma Consortium identified heterozygous FH germline mutations in patients with multiple cutaneous and uterine leiomyomas (MCUL: OMIM 150800). In some families, renal cell cancer is also a component of the complex and, as such, has been described as hereditary leiomyomatosis and renal cell cancer (HLRCC: OMIM 605839). The identification of FH as a tumor suppressor was an unexpected finding and, after the identification of succinate dehydrogenase subunits in 2000 and 2001, it was only the second description of the involvement of an intermediary metabolism enzyme in tumorigenesis. DESCRIPTION: The FH Mutation Database is part of the TCA Cycle Gene Mutation Database (formerly the Succinate Dehydrogenase Gene Mutation Database) and is based on the Leiden Open system (source) Variation Database (LOVD). Variants included in the database were derived from published literature and annotated to conform to current mutation nomenclature. The FH database applies the HGVS nomenclature guidelines and will help researchers apply these guidelines when directly submitting new sequence variants online. Since the first molecular characterization of an FH mutation by Bourgeron et al. in 1994, a series of reports in both FH deficiency and MCUL/HLRRC patients described 107 variants, of which 93 were thought to be pathogenic. The most common type of mutation is missense (57%), followed by frameshifts and nonsense (27%) and various deletions, insertions and duplications. Here we introduce an online database detailing all reported FH sequence variants. CONCLUSION:The FH Mutation Database strives to systematically unify all current genetic knowledge about FH variants. We believe that this knowledge will help clinical geneticists and treating physicians in counseling patients and their families, provide a quick and convenient resource for scientific researchers, and may eventually contribute to gaining new knowledge about FH and its associated clinical syndromes.\n",
      "PURPOSE: Mutations in the SOX2 and CHX10 genes have been reported in patients suffering from anophthalmia and/or microphthalmia. In this study, we evaluated 34 DNA samples from anophthalmic/microphthalmic patients (two sibling groups included) for mutations and sequence variants in SOX2 and CHX10. METHODS: Sensitive conformational gel electrophoresis (CSGE) was used for initial screening of SOX2 and CHX10 in 34 affected individuals (two sibling groups), five unaffected family members, and 80 healthy controls. Patient samples containing heteroduplexes were selected for sequence analysis. Base pair changes in SOX2 and CHX10 were confirmed by bidirectional sequencing in patient samples. RESULTS: Two novel heterozygous mutations and two sequence variants (one known) in SOX2 were identified in this cohort. The c.310 G>T (p. Glu104X) mutation, found in one patient, was in the region encoding the high mobility group (HMG) DNA binding domain and resulted in passage of the glutamic acid has a stop codon. The second mutation, noted in two affected siblings, was a single-nucleotide deletion c.549delC (p. Pro184ArgfsX19) in the region encoding the activation domain, resulting in a frameshift and premature termination of the coding sequence. Shortened protein products can cause loss of function. Additionally, a novel nucleotide substitution c.*557G>A was identified in the 3' untranslated region in one patient. The relationship between nucleotide change and protein function is undetermined. A known single nucleotide polymorphism (i.e. *469 C>A, SNP rs11915160) was also detected in 2 of 34 patients. Screening of CHX10 identified two synonymous sequence variants, approximately 471 C>T (p.Ser157Ser, rs35435463) and approximately 579 G>A (p. Gln193Gln, novel SNP), and one non-synonymous sequence variant, approximately 871 G . >A (p. Asp291Asn, SNP novel). Non-synonymous polymorphism was also present in healthy controls, suggesting non-causality. CONCLUSIONS: These results support the role of SOX2 in ocular development. Loss of SOX2 function leads to serious ocular malformations. CHX10 was not involved in microphthalmia/anophthalmia in our patient cohort.\n",
      "PURPOSE: Pituitary adenomas rarely occur during childhood and adolescence. Predisposition to pituitary adenoma (PAP) has recently been associated with germline mutations in the aryl hydrocarbon receptor-interacting protein (AIP) gene. The aim of the study was to examine the proportion of germline AIP mutations in apparently sporadic pediatric pituitary adenomas. DESIGN: Genomic DNA was analyzed for AIP gene mutations, by PCR amplification and direct sequencing. PATIENTS: A population-based cohort, consisting of 36 apparently sporadic pediatric patients with pituitary adenoma, referred to two medical centers in Italy, was included in the study. Patients were younger than 18 years at diagnosis or had clinical signs of adenoma development before age 18. RESULTS: A heterozygous deletion Y248del (c.742_744delTAC) was identified in a patient with GH-secreting adenoma. Loss of heterozygosity (LOH) analysis of tumor DNA revealed loss of the wild-type allele. First-degree relatives carrying the mutation were clinically unaffected. CONCLUSIONS: Although mutations are absent in patients with non-GH-secreting adenomas, germline AIP mutations can be found in children and adolescents with GH-secreting tumors even in the absence family history. The present study reports the results of the analysis of AIP mutations in patients of a single ethnic origin. Clearly, further studies are needed to improve our knowledge of the role of AIP in pediatric pituitary adenomas.\n",
      "BACKGROUND: Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) are involved in the degradation of the extracellular matrix of the intervertebral disc. A SNP for guanine insertion/deletion (G/D), promoter polymorphism -1607, of the MMP1 gene was found to significantly affect promoter activity and corresponding transcription level. It is therefore a good candidate for genetic studies in DDD. METHODS:Southern Chinese volunteers aged 18 to 55 years were recruited from the population. DDD at the lumbar spine was defined by MRI according to the Schneiderman classification. Genomic DNA was isolated from leukocytes and genotyping was performed using the Sequenom platform. Verification of association and Hardy-Weinberg balance was assessed by the Chi-square test and the Mann-Whitney U test. RESULTS:Our results showed substantial evidence of an association between the -1607 promoter polymorphism of MMP1 and DDD in southern Chinese subjects. The D allele was significantly associated with DDD (p-value = 0.027, odds ratio = 1.41 with 95% CI = 1.04-1.90) while the genotypic association on the presence of the D allele was also significantly associated with DDD (p-value = 0.046, odds ratio = 1.04-1.90). 1.50 with 95% CI = 1.01-2.24). Further stratification by age showed a significant genotypic and allelic association in the over 40 group (genotypic: p-value = 0.035, odds ratio = 1.617 with 95% CI = 1.033-2.529; allelic: p-value = 0.033, odds ratio = 1.445 with 95% CI = 1.029-2.029). Disc bulge, annular tears, and Schmorl's nodes were not associated with the D allele. CONCLUSION: We demonstrated that individuals with the presence of the D allele for the -1607 promoter polymorphism of MMP1 are approximately 1.5 times more likely to develop DDD than those with only the G allele. An additional association was identified in individuals over 40 years of age. Disc bulge, annular tear and Schmorl's lymph nodes were not associated with this polymorphism.\n",
      "The present study aimed to investigate the anticonvulsant activity as well as the effects on the level of hippocampal amino acid neurotransmitters (glutamate, aspartate, glycine and GABA) of N-(2-propylpentanoyl)urea (VPU) compared to its parent compound, valproic acid (VPA). VPU was more potent than VPA, exhibiting a median effective dose (ED(50)) of 49 mg/kg to protect rats against pilocarpine-induced seizures, while the corresponding value for VPA was 322 mg/kg. kg. In vivo microdialysis demonstrated that intraperitoneal administration of pilocarpine induced a pronounced increase in hippocampal glutamate and aspartate while no significant changes were observed in glycine and GABA. Pretreatment with VPU (50 and 100 mg/kg) or VPA (300 and 600 mg/kg) completely abolished pilocarpine-evoked increases in extracellular glutamate and aspartate. Additionally, a statistically significant reduction was also observed in the level of GABA and glycine but less than a drastic reduction in the level of glutamate and aspartate. Based on the finding that VPU and VPA could protect animals against pilocarpine-induced seizures, it is suggested that the reduction in inhibitory amino acid neurotransmitters was relatively minor and compensated by a pronounced reduction in glutamate and aspartate. Therefore, like VPA, the finding that VPU could significantly reduce pilocarpine-induced increases in glutamate and aspartate should explain, at least in part, its anticonvulsant activity observed in pilocarpine-induced seizures in animals. laboratory. Certain mechanisms other than those reported here should be the subject of further study.\n",
      "BACKGROUND:Exposure to anthracyclines as part of cancer treatment has been associated with the development of congestive heart failure (CHF). The potential role of genetic risk factors in anthracycline-related CHF remains to be defined. Thus, in this study, the authors examined whether common polymorphisms in candidate genes involved in anthracycline pharmacodynamics (specifically the nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate gene NQO1: quinone oxidoreductase 1 gene and the carbonyl reductase gene 3 CBR3) had an impact on risk. of anthracycline-related CHF. METHODS: A nested case-control study was conducted in a cohort of 1,979 patients enrolled in the Childhood Cancer Survivors Study who received anthracycline therapy and had DNA available. Thirty CHF patients (cases) and 115 matched controls were genotyped for NQO1 (NQO1*2) and CBR3 (substitution of valine [V] of CBR3 for methionine [M] at position 244 [V244M]) polymorphisms. ). Enzyme activity assays with recombinant CBR3 isoforms (CBR3 V244 and CBR3 M244) and the anthracycline substrate doxorubicin were used to study the functional impact of the CBR3 V244M polymorphism. RESULTS: Multivariate analyzes adjusted for sex and primary disease recurrence were used to test associations between candidate genetic polymorphisms (NQO1*2 and CBR3 V244M) and CHF risk. Analyzes indicated no association between the NQO1*2 polymorphism and risk of anthracycline-related CHF (odds ratio [OR], 1.04; P = 0.97). There was a trend toward an association between CBR3 V244M polymorphism and risk of CHF (OR: 8.16; P = 0.056 for G/G vs A/A; OR: 5.44; P = 0.092 for G/ A vs A/UN). Online, recombinant CBR3 V244 (G allele) synthesized 2.6 times more cardiotoxic doxorubicinol per unit time than CBR3 M244 (A allele; CBR3 V244 [8.26+/-3.57 nmol/hour.mg ] vs CBR3 M244 [3.22+/- 0.67 nmol/hour.mg]; 0.01). CONCLUSIONS:The CBR3 V244M functional polymorphism may impact the risk of anthracycline-related CHF in childhood cancer survivors by modulating the intracardiac formation of cardiotoxic anthracycline alcohol metabolites. Larger confirmatory case-control studies are warranted.\n",
      "OBJECTIVE: To report the clinical, ophthalmic and genetic characteristics of corneal lattice dystrophy type I (LCDI) in a Chilean family. METHODS: Six affected family members were examined clinically, including visual acuity, corneal color photography, applanation tonography, and fundoscopy. Genomic DNA was extracted from peripheral leukocytes of six affected and three unaffected members of a family with lattice corneal dystrophy type I. Transforming growth factor-induced gene (TGFBI) exon 4 was screened for the most common mutation, R124C, in the proband. by sequencing. We also designed a rapid polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) method to analyze the same mutation, by amplifying exon 4 and digesting it with the restriction enzyme PstI. Using this strategy, we analyzed the mutation in six affected and three healthy family members. RESULTS: Three generations of family members were positively diagnosed with lattice corneal dystrophy. Six participants exhibited LCD1 in both eyes, most of which were symmetrical. The age of onset of symptoms varied (3 to 42 years). Furthermore, in this family, the age of onset of the disease decreased over the generations, which could be interpreted as anticipation. Visual acuity ranged from 1.0 to 0.13. Two patients, aged 69 and 44, presented with a severity grade of “Poor” based on best-corrected vision and corneal engagement. The proband's TGFBI exon 4 sequence has the heterozygous single-nucleotide mutation, C417T, leading to the amino acid substitution (R124C) in the TGF-induced encoded protein. Using PCR-RFLP, we confirmed the heterozygous mutation in six affected family members and excluded it in three healthy members. CONCLUSIONS: The R124C mutation of TGFBI was found with type I LCD in the studied family. This is the first report of a molecular analysis of type I LCD in Chilean patients. The early onset of affected individuals during the fourth generation raises the possibility of anticipation.\n",
      "Vasoactive intestinal polypeptide (VIP) is an immunomodulatory neuropeptide distributed in the voiding tract. VIP(-/-) mice exhibit impaired bladder function and neurochemical properties in the voiding tract after cyclophosphamide (CYP)-induced cystitis. Given the role of VIP as an anti-inflammatory mediator, we hypothesized that VIP(-/-) mice would exhibit increased expression of the inflammatory mediator after cystitis. An array of mouse inflammatory cytokine and RT2 receptor profilers was used to determine regulated transcripts in the bladder of wild-type (WT) and VIP (-/-) mice with or without CYP-induced cystitis (150 mg /kg i.p.; Four binary comparisons were performed: WT control versus CYP treatment (48 h), VIP(-/-) control versus CYP treatment (48 h), WT control versus VIP(-/-) control, and WT with CYP treatment (48 h ). ) versus VIP(-/-) with CYP treatment (48 h). The genes shown represent (1) a greater than 1.5-fold change in either direction and (2) the p-value is less than 0.05 for the comparison performed. Several regulated genes were validated using enzyme-linked immunoassays, including IL-1beta and CXCL1. CYP treatment significantly (p < or = 0.001) increased the expression of CXCL1 and IL-1beta in the bladder of WT and VIP (-/-) mice, but increased the expression in VIP (-/-) mice. -/-) treated with CYP was significantly (p < or = 0.001) higher (4.2- to 13-fold increase) than that observed in the WT bladder (3.6- to 5-fold increase). times). Data suggest that in VIP(-/-) mice with bladder inflammation, inflammatory mediators are higher than those observed in WT mice with CYP. This shift in balance may contribute to increased bladder dysfunction in VIP(-/-) mice with bladder inflammation and altered neurochemical expression in the voiding tract.\n",
      "TAC has been shown to be a potent immunosuppressive agent for pediatric solid organ transplantation. Neurotoxicity is a potentially serious toxic effect. It is characterized by encephalopathy, headaches, seizures or neurological deficits. Here we describe an eight and a half year old male kidney transplant recipient with right BN. MRI demonstrated hyperintense T2 signals in the cervical cord and roots of the right brachial plexus, indicating both myelitis and right brachial plexitis. Symptoms persisted for three months despite TAC dose reduction, IVIG administration, and four doses of methylprednisolone pulse therapy. Improvement and ultimately complete recovery occurred only after complete cessation of TAC and successful replacement with everolimus.\n",
      "INTRODUCTION: Somatic alterations have been shown to correlate with breast cancer prognosis and survival, but less is known about the effects of common inherited genetic variations. Of particular interest are genes involved in cell cycle pathways, which regulate cell division. METHODS: We examined associations between common germline genetic variations in 13 genes involved in cell cycle control (CCND1, CCND2, CCND3, CCNE1, CDK2[p33], CDK4, CDK6, CDKN1A[p21, Cip1], CDKN1B[ p27, Kip1], CDKN2A [p16], CDKN2B [p15], CDKN2C [p18], and CDKN2D [p19]) and survival in women diagnosed with invasive breast cancer participating in the SEARCH Breast Cancer Study (Studies of Epidemiology and Risk Factors in Cancer Heredity). The DNA of 4,470 women was genotyped for 85 polymorphisms that mark known common polymorphisms (minor allele frequency >0.05) in genes. Genotypes of each polymorphism were tested for their association with survival using Cox regression analysis. RESULTS: The rare allele of the single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) rs2479717 is associated with an increased risk of death (hazard ratio = 1.26 per carried rare allele, 95% confidence interval: 1.12 to 1.42; P = 0.0001), which was not the case. attenuated after adjustment for tumor stage, grade and treatment. This SNP is part of a large linkage disequilibrium block, which contains CCND3, BYSL, TRFP, USP49, C6ofr49, FRS3, and PGC. We assessed the association between survival and somatic expression of these genes in breast tumors using expression microarray data from seven published datasets. High expression of the C6orf49 transcript was associated with breast cancer survival, adding biological relevance to the finding. CONCLUSION: It is possible that CCND3 rs2479717, or another variant it labels, is associated with prognosis after a breast cancer diagnosis. Further study is needed to validate this finding.\n",
      "We studied the effects of antithrombin, a plasma inhibitor of clotting factors, in rats with puromycin aminonucleoside-induced nephrosis, which is an experimental model of human nephrotic syndrome. Antithrombin (50 or 500 IU/kg/iv) was administered to rats once daily for 10 days immediately after injection of puromycin aminonucleoside (50 mg/kg/iv). Antithrombin treatment attenuated puromycin aminonucleoside-induced hematologic abnormalities. Renal dysfunction and hyperlipidemia induced by puromycin aminonucleoside were also suppressed. Histopathological examination revealed severe renal lesions such as protein casts in the tubuli and tubular expansion in the kidneys of control rats, while improvement of lesions was observed in antithrombin-treated rats. Furthermore, antithrombin treatment markedly suppressed the aminonucleoside puromycin-induced apoptosis of renal tubular epithelial cells. In addition, puromycin aminonucleoside-induced increases in renal cytokine content were also decreased. These results suggest that thrombin plays an important role in the pathogenesis of puromycin aminonucleoside-induced nephrotic syndrome. Antithrombin therapy may be clinically effective in patients with nephrotic syndrome.\n",
      "BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Despite the benefits of induction and maintenance of sevoflurane anesthesia, postoperative nausea and vomiting frequently occur. Fentanyl is a commonly used supplement that may contribute to this, although it may also improve analgesia. METHODS: This double-blind study examined the incidence and severity of postoperative nausea, vomiting, and pain during the first 24 hours after sevoflurane anesthesia in 216 adult day surgery patients. Patients were randomly assigned to receive 1 1 of fentanyl or not, while a third group received dexamethasone in addition to fentanyl. RESULTS: Omission of fentanyl did not reduce the overall incidence of postoperative nausea and vomiting, but reduced the incidence of moderate to severe vomiting and/or nausea before discharge by 20% and 17% with fentanyl and fentanyl-dexamethasone, respectively, at 5% (P = 0.013). Antiemetic requirements were reduced from 24% and 31% to 7% (P = 0.0012). Dexamethasone had no significant effect on the incidence or severity of postoperative nausea and vomiting. Combining the two fentanyl groups revealed additional significant benefits related to opioid avoidance, reducing postoperative nausea and vomiting and predischarge nausea from 35% and 33% to 22% and 19% (P = 0.049 and P = 0.035), respectively, while nausea in the first 24 hours decreased from 42% to 27% (P = 0.034). Pain intensity and analgesic requirements were not affected by omission of fentanyl. Fentanyl effectively reduced minor intraoperative movements, but had no sparing effect on sevoflurane and increased respiratory depression, hypotension, and bradycardia. CONCLUSION: Because fentanyl exacerbated postoperative nausea and vomiting without improvement in postoperative pain and also had adverse cardiorespiratory effects, it appears to be an unnecessary and potentially harmful adjunct to sevoflurane in day surgery.\n",
      "Curcumin is the active component of turmeric, and this polyphenolic compound has been widely studied as an anticancer drug that modulates multiple pathways and genes. In this study, 10 to 25 micromoles/L of curcumin inhibited the growth of 253JB-V and KU7 bladder cancer cells, which was accompanied by induction of apoptosis and a decrease in expression of the pro-apoptotic protein survivin and the angiogenic proteins vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and VEGF receptor 1 (VEGFR1). Since the expression of survivin, VEGF, and VEGFR1 depends on specificity protein (Sp) transcription factors, we also investigated the effects of curcumin on Sp protein expression as a mechanism underlying the apoptotic and antiangiogenic activity of this compound. The results show that curcumin induced proteasome-dependent downregulation of Sp1, Sp3, and Sp4 in 253JB-V and KU7 cells. Furthermore, using RNA interference with small RNA inhibitors of Sp1, Sp3, and Sp4, we observed that curcumin-dependent inhibition of nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB)-dependent genes, such as bcl-2, survivin, and cyclin D1, was also due, in part, to loss of Sp proteins. Curcumin also decreased the growth of bladder tumors in cell-bearing athymic nude mice KU7 in the form of xenografts, which was accompanied by a decrease in the levels of Sp1, Sp3 and Sp4 proteins in the tumors. These results show for the first time that one of the underlying mechanisms of action of curcumin as an anticancer chemotherapeutic agent is due, in part, to a decrease in the expression of Sp transcription factors in cells. bladder cancers.\n",
      "The penicillin model is a widely used experimental model for epilepsy research. In the present study, we aimed to present a detailed spectral analysis of penicillin-induced epileptiform activity relative to basal brain activity in anesthetized Wistar rats. Male Wistar rats were anesthetized i.p. urethane and connected to an electrocorticogram setup. After a short period of recording basal activity, a seizure focus was induced by injecting 400 IU/2 μl of potassium penicillin-G into the left lateral ventricle while cortical activity was recorded continuously. Basal activity, latency period, and periods of penicillin-induced epileptiform activity were then analyzed using conventional methods and spectral analysis. Spectral analyzes were performed by dividing the entire spectrum into different frequency bands, including delta, theta (slow and fast), alpha-sigma, beta (1 and 2), and gamma (1 and 2). Our results show that the most affected frequency bands were the delta, theta, beta-2 and gamma-2 bands during epileptiform activity and that there were marked differences in spectral densities between the three episodes studied ( basal activity, latency period and epileptiform activity). . Our results can help analyze new data obtained using similar experimental models and the simple analysis method described here can be used in similar studies to investigate the basic neuronal mechanism of this type of experimental epilepsy or d other types of experimental epilepsy.\n"
