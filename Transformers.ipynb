      "We report a novel allele at the arylsulfatase A (ARSA) locus causing late-onset metachromatic leukodystrophy (MLD). In this allele, arginine84, a highly conserved residue in the arylsulfatase gene family, is replaced by glutamine. Unlike alleles that cause early MLD, substitution of arginine84 for glutamine is associated with some residual ARSA activity. A comparison of genotypes, ARSA activities, and clinical data on 4 individuals carrying the allele from 81 MLD patients examined further validates the concept that different degrees of residual ARSA activity underlie the Phenotypic variation in MLD.\n",
      "Classic phenylketonuria is an autosomal recessive disorder caused by hepatic phenylalanine hydroxylase (PAH) deficiency. The abolition of an invariant BamHI site located in the coding sequence of the PAH gene (exon 7) led to the recognition of two new point mutations at codons 272 and 273 (272gly----stop and 273ser--- -phe, respectively). Both mutations were detected in the north-east of France or in Belgium and occurred against a background of alleles of the 7 RFLP haplotype. The present study supports the idea that the clinical heterogeneity of PKU is explained by the wide variety of mutant genotypes associated with PAH deficiencies.\n",
      "The metabolism of the cardioselective beta-blocker metoprolol is under debrisoquine/sparteine ​​genetic control. The two metabolic phenotypes, extensive (EM) and poor metabolizers (PM), exhibit different stereoselective metabolism, resulting in apparently higher beta-1 adrenergic receptor antagonistic potency of racemic metoprolol in EM. We examined whether the latter also applies to beta-2 adrenergic receptor antagonism by metoprolol. The drug effect studied was the antagonism of metoprolol against terbutaline-induced hypokalemia. Using pharmacodynamic pharmacokinetic modeling, the pharmacodynamics of racemic metoprolol and the active S isomer were quantified in EM and PM in terms of IC50 values, representing plasma concentrations of metoprolol resulting in half-maximal receptor occupancy. Six EMs received 0.5 mg of terbutaline s.c. on two different occasions: 1) 1 hour after the administration of a placebo and 2) 1 hour after 150 mg of metoprolol p.o. Five PMs were studied according to the same protocol, at with the exception of a higher dose of terbutaline (0.75 mg) on ​​day 2. Blood samples for analysis of plasma potassium, terbutaline, metoprolol (racemic, R and S isomer) and l 'alpha-Hydroxymetoprolol concentrations were taken at regular intervals, for 8 hours after metoprolol. In PM, metoprolol increased the area under the plasma concentration-time curve of terbutaline (+67%). Higher metoprolol/alpha-hydroxymetoprolol ratios in PM were predictive of higher R-/S isomer ratios of unchanged drug. There was a difference in the potency of metoprolol with higher racemic IC50 values ​​in PM (72 +/- 7 ng.ml-1) than in EM (42 +/- 8 ng.ml-1, P less than 0.001). (SUMMARY TRUNCATED TO 250 WORDS)\n",
      "Previous experiments in this laboratory have shown that microinjection of methyldopa onto ventrolateral cells of serotonergic B3 neurons in the spinal cord causes a hypotensive response mediated by a projection down the spinal cord. The present experiments were designed to investigate the role of midcells of B3 serotonergic neurons in the medulla, coinciding with raphe magnus. In spontaneously hypertensive and stroke-prone rats, microinjection of methyldopa into the area of ​​the middle group of serotonergic B3 cells of the ventral medulla caused potent hypotension of 30 to 40 mm Hg, which was maximal 2 to 3 hours after administration and abolished by the serotonergic neurotoxin 5,7-dihydroxytryptamine (5,7-DHT) injected intracerebroventricularly. However, intraspinal injection of 5,7-DHT to produce a more selective lesion of only descending serotonin projections in the spinal cord did not affect this hypotension. Furthermore, 5,7-DHT injury of serotonergic nerves traveling in the medial forebrain bundle, one of the major ascending pathways from serotonergic B3 cells, did not affect the associated drop in blood pressure to a median serotonin B3 injection of methyldopa. We therefore conclude that, unlike ventrolateral B3 cells which mediate methyldopa-induced hypotension via descending projections, midline serotonergic B3 cells contribute to the hypotensive action of methyldopa, either through an ascending projection which does not pass through the median bundle of the forebrain, or by a projection limited to the caudal brainstem.\n",
      "Eighty unrelated individuals with Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) or Becker muscular dystrophy (BMD) had deletions in the core deletion-rich region of the DMD locus. This region includes the last five exons detected by cDNA5b-7, all exons detected by cDNA8, and the first two exons detected by cDNA9. These 80 individuals represent approximately 75% of the 109 gene deletions detected among 181 patients analyzed with the entire dystrophin cDNA. The parameters of many of these deletions were further characterized using two genomic probes, p20 (DXS269; Wapenaar et al.) and GMGX11 (DXS239; this article). The clinical results are presented for all 80 patients allowing a correlation between phenotypic severity and genotype. Thirty-eight independent patients were old enough to be classified as DMD, BMD, or intermediate phenotype and had exon deletions with sequenced intron/exon boundaries. Among them, eight DMD patients and one intermediate patient had genetic deletions likely to leave the reading frame intact, while 21 DMD patients, 7 intermediate patients, and 1 BMD patient had genetic deletions likely to disrupt the reading frame. Thus, with two exceptions, frameshift deletions of the gene resulted in a more severe phenotype than in-frame deletions. This is in agreement with recent findings by Baumbach et al. and Koenig et al. but this contrasts with the results of Malhotra et al. at the 5' end of the gene.\n",
      "Serious cardiovascular complications occurred in eight of 160 patients treated with terbutaline for premature labor. Associated corticosteroid therapy and twin gestations appear to be predisposing factors. Potential mechanisms of pathophysiology are briefly discussed.\n",
      "Two overlapping cDNA clones (1,991 bp and 736 bp, respectively) encoding the human mitochondrial very long-chain acyl-coenzyme A dehydrogenase (VLCAD) precursor were cloned and sequenced. The cDNA inserts from these clones together encompass a region of 2,177 bases, encoding the entire protein of 655 amino acids, including a leader peptide of 40 amino acids and a mature polypeptide of 615 amino acids. PCR-amplified VLCAD cDNAs were sequenced in cultured fibroblasts from two VLCAD-deficient patients. In both patients, a 105 bp deletion encompassing bases 1078-1182 in the VLCAD cDNA was identified. The deletion appears to occur due to exon skipping during processing of VLCAD pre-mRNA. This is the first demonstration of a mutation causing VLCAD deficiency. Quantitative expression of normal human VLCAD cDNA was carried out in patient fibroblasts, using the vaccinia viral system, which demonstrated that deficiency of normal VLCAD protein causes impairment of VLCAD activity. beta-oxidation of long-chain fatty acids in patient fibroblasts. In patient fibroblasts, increasing VLCAD activity to approximately 20% of the normal activity of control fibroblasts increased the flux of palmitic acid beta-oxidation to the level found in control fibroblasts, which may offer important insights for the rational design of future somatic gene therapy for VLCAD deficiency.\n",
      "A human mu opiate receptor cDNA was identified from a cerebral cortex cDNA library using sequences from the rat mu opiate receptor cDNA. The human mu opiate receptor (h mu OR1) shares 95% amino acid identity with the rat sequence. Expressed mu OR1 recognized opiate drugs and tested opioid peptides in a sodium- and GTP-sensitive manner with affinities virtually identical to those displayed by the rat mu opiate receptor. The effects on cyclic AMP are similar to those observed for the rat mu opiate receptor. An 18 kb genomic clone hybridizing with h mu OR1 cDNA contains exonic sequences of 63 and 489 bp flanked by donor/acceptor splicing sequences. Hybridization analysis to DNA prepared from human rodent hybrid cell lines and chromosomal in situ hybridization studies indicate localization at 6q24-25. An MspI polymorphism, producing a band of 3.7 kb, could prove useful to evaluate the involvement of this gene in neuropsychiatric disorders involving the opiatergic systems.\n",
      "We identified 14 families with ataxia-telangiectasia (A-T) in which the ATM gene mutation is associated with a less severe clinical and cellular phenotype (approximately 10-15% of A-T families identified in the UK). . In 10 of these families, all homozygotes have a 137 bp insertion in their cDNA caused by a point mutation in a sequence resembling a splice donor site. The second A-T allele has a different mutation in each patient. We show that the less severe phenotype in these patients is due to some degree of normal splicing, which occurs as an alternative product from the allele containing the insertion. The level of the 137-bp PCR product containing the insertion was lowest in two patients with later-onset cerebellar ataxia. Four other families who do not benefit from this integration have been identified. The mutations detected in two of them are missense mutations, normally rare in A-T patients. The demonstration of mutations giving rise to a slightly milder phenotype in A-T raises the interesting question of what range of phenotypes might arise in individuals in whom both mutations are milder. One possibility could be that compound heterozygous individuals for ATM mutations are more common than we think.\n",
      "Nefiracetam is a novel pyrrolidone derivative that attenuates scopolamine-induced post-training learning and consolidation deficits. Since apomorphine inhibits passive avoidance retention when administered during training or in a defined period of 10 to 12 hours after training, we evaluated the ability of nefiracetam to attenuate induced amnesia by dopamine agonism. A progressive passive avoidance paradigm was used and nefiracetam (3 mg/kg) and apomorphine (0.5 mg/kg) were administered alone or in combination during training and during the consolidation period of 10 at 12 hours after training. Co-administration of nefiracetam and apomorphine during training or 10 hours after training produced no significant anti-amnestic effects. However, administering nefiracetam during training completely reversed apomorphine-induced amnesia 10 hours after training and the reverse was also true. These effects were not mediated by a dopaminergic mechanism since nefiracetam, at millimolar concentrations, failed to displace the binding of [3H]SCH 23390 or [3H]spiperine from dopamine D1 receptor subtypes or D2, respectively. Nefiracetam is suggested to increase molecular processes in the early stages of events that ultimately lead to memory consolidation.\n",
      "Myotonic dystrophy (DM), the most common muscle disorder in adults, is caused by the n-repeat (CTG) expansion of a gene encoding a protein kinase (DM protein kinase; DMPK) and involves changes of cytoarchitecture and ionic homeostasis. To obtain clues about the normal biological role of DMPK in cellular ion homeostasis, we compared resting [Ca2+]i, the amplitude and shape of depolarization-induced Ca2+ transients, and the content of ATP-driven ion pumps in cultured skeletal cells. muscle cells from wild-type and DMPK [-/-] knockout mice. In vitro differentiated DMPK[-/-] myotubes exhibit higher resting [Ca2+]i than wild-type myotubes due to altered open probability of voltage-gated l-type Ca2+ and Na+ channels . Mutant myotubes exhibit smaller and slower Ca2+ responses when triggered by acetylcholine or high external K+. Furthermore, we observed that these Ca2+ transients result in part from an influx of extracellular Ca2+ through the l-type Ca2+ channel. Neither the content nor the activity of Na+/K+ ATPase and sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2+-ATPase are affected by the absence of DMPK. In conclusion, our data suggest that DMPK is involved in modulating the initial events of excitation-contraction coupling in skeletal muscle.\n",
      "NADH: Ubiquinone oxidoreductase (complex I) of the mitochondrial respiratory chain can be fragmented into a subfraction of flavoprotein (FP), iron-sulfur protein (IP), and hydrophobic protein (HP). The IP subfraction is assumed to be significant, as it contains important prosthetic groups that are highly conserved among species. We cloned the cDNA of three remaining human NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase subunits from this IP fraction: NDUFS2 (49 kDa), NDUFS3 (30 kDa), and NDUFS6 (13 kDa). All cDNAs presented include the complete open reading frame (ORF), consisting of 1,392, 795, and 375 base pairs, encoding 463, 264, and 124 amino acids, respectively. The latter present 96, 90 and 83% homology with the corresponding bovine translation products. The 3' untranslated regions (UTRs) are complete in all three cDNAs. Polymerase chain reaction performed with DNA isolated from human-rodent somatic cell hybrids containing defined human chromosomes as template yielded a human-specific signal that mapped the NDUFS2 and NDUFS3 subunits to the chromosomes 1 and 11, respectively. In the case of the NDUFS6 subunit, a pseudogene may be present since signals were observed in the bands containing chromosomes 5 and 6. NDUFS2 contains a highly conserved protein kinase C phosphorylation site and the subunit NDUFS3 contains a highly conserved casein kinase II phosphorylation site which makes them strong candidates for future mutation detection studies in enzyme complex I deficient patients.\n",
      "A healthy 17-year-old male received standard intermittent doses of pethidine via a patient-controlled analgesia (PCA) pump for management of postoperative pain control. Twenty-three hours after surgery, he developed a brief, self-limiting seizure. Both plasma pethidine and norpethidine were elevated in the range associated with clinical manifestations of central nervous system excitation. No other risk factors for CNS toxicity have been identified. This method allowed frequent self-dosing of pethidine at short intervals and rapid accumulation of pethidine and norpethidine. The routine use of pethidine via PCA, even for brief postoperative analgesia, should be reconsidered.\n",
      "Carbamazepine and vigabatrin are contraindicated in typical absence seizures. Of 18 consecutive referrals of children presenting only resistant typical absences, eight were mistakenly treated with carbamazepine, either as monotherapy or as an adjunct. Vigabatrin was also used in the treatment of two children. The frequency of absences increased in four children treated with carbamazepine and two of them developed myoclonic jerks, which disappeared when carbamazepine treatment was stopped. The absences were worsened in both cases when vigabatrin was added to concomitant treatment. Optimal absence control was achieved with sodium valproate, lamotrigine or ethosuximide alone or in combination.\n",
      "Hepatocyte nuclear transcription factor (HNF)-6 is an upstream regulator of several genes involved in the pathogenesis of mature-onset diabetes in the young. We therefore tested the hypothesis that HNF-6 gene variability is associated with subsets of type II (non-insulin-dependent) diabetes mellitus and estimates of insulin secretion in tolerant subjects. glucose.   We cloned the coding region as well as the intron-exon boundaries of the HNF-6 gene. We then examined them on genomic DNA in six MODY candidates without mutations in MODY1, MODY3 and MODY4 genes and in 54 patients with late-onset type II diabetes by combined single-stranded conformational polymorphism-heteroduplex analysis followed by direct sequencing of identified variants. One missense variant identified was examined in association studies and genotype-phenotype studies.   We identified two silent variants and one missense variant (Pro75 Ala). In an association study, the allele frequency of the Pro75Ala polymorphism was 3.2% (95% confidence interval, 1.9-4.5) in 330 patients with type II diabetes mellitus compared to 4.2 % (2.4-6.0) in 238 age-matched glucose tolerant control subjects. . Moreover, in studies involving 238 middle-aged glucose-tolerant subjects, 226 glucose-tolerant descendants of type II diabetic patients, and 367 young healthy subjects, carriers of the polymorphism did not differ from non-carriers in terms glucose-induced serum insulin or C-peptide responses.   Mutations in the coding region of the HNF-6 gene are not associated with type II diabetes or changes in insulin responses to glucose in examined Caucasians.\n",
      "We identified a Ca2+-dependent type II lectin with mannose-binding specificity, exclusively expressed by Langerhans cells (LC), and named Langerin. LCs are uniquely characterized by Birbeck granules (BG), which are organelles consisting of overlapping, zip-like membranes. Here, we showed that Langerin is constitutively associated with BG and that antibodies against Langerin are internalized into these structures. Remarkably, transfection of Langerin cDNA into fibroblasts created a compact network of membrane structures exhibiting typical features of BG. Langerin is therefore a powerful inducer of membrane and zipper superposition leading to the formation of BG. Our data suggest that blood glucose induction is a consequence of the antigen-capture function of Langerin, enabling its trafficking to these organelles and providing access to a non-classical antigen processing pathway.\n",
      "We undertook a hospital-based study to identify possible founder mutations of BRCA1 and BRCA2 in the Polish population. The study group consisted of 66 Polish cancer families who had at least three female relatives with breast or ovarian cancer and were diagnosed with cancer, in at least one of the three affected women , at an age < 50 years. A total of 26 families had both breast cancer and ovarian cancer, 4 families had ovarian cancer only, and 36 families had breast cancer only. Genomic DNA was prepared from peripheral blood leukocytes of at least one affected woman from each family. The entire coding region of BRCA1 and BRCA2 was screened for the presence of germline mutations, using SSCP followed by direct sequencing of the observed variants. Mutations were found in 35 (53%) of the 66 families studied. All but one of the mutations were detected in the BRCA1 gene. BRCA1 abnormalities were identified in all four families with ovarian cancer only, in 67% of 27 families with both breast and ovarian cancer, and in 34% of 35 families. with breast cancer only. The only family with a BRCA2 mutation suffered from breast and ovarian cancer syndrome. Seven distinct mutations were identified; five of these occurred in two or more families. In total, recurrent mutations were found in 33 (94%) of 35 families with detected mutations. Three BRCA1 abnormalities – 5382insC, C61G and 4153delA – accounted for 51%, 20% and 11% of the identified mutations, respectively.\n",
      "Apomorphine was the first dopaminergic drug ever used to treat the symptoms of Parkinson's disease. While potent antiparkinsonian effects had been observed as early as 1951, the potential for treating fluctuating Parkinson's disease by subcutaneous administration of apomorphine has only recently been systematically studied. A number of small-scale clinical trials have shown unequivocally that intermittent subcutaneous injections of apomorphine produce an antiparkinsonian benefit close to, if not identical to, that observed with levodopa and that rescue injections of apomorphine can reverse reliably off-periods, even in patients with complex on-off motor oscillations. Continuous subcutaneous infusions of apomorphine can reduce daily downtime by more than 50% in this group of patients, which appears to be a stronger effect than that typically seen with adjunctive treatment with dopamine agonists oral or COMT inhibitors. Extended follow-up studies of up to 8 years have demonstrated long-term persistence of apomorphine's effectiveness. Additionally, there is compelling clinical evidence that monotherapy with continuous subcutaneous infusions of apomorphine is associated with a marked reduction in pre-existing levodopa-induced dyskinesias. The main side effects of subcutaneous apomorphine treatment are related to skin tolerance problems, while sedation and psychiatric complications play a lesser role. Given the marked degree of effectiveness of subcutaneous apomorphine treatment in fluctuating Parkinson's disease, this approach appears to merit broader clinical use.\n",
      "A novel cDNA homolog of Rab6, Rab6c, was discovered by a hypermethylated DNA fragment probe that was isolated from a multidrug-resistant (MDR) human breast cancer cell line, MCF7/AdrR, by the assay technique differences in representation sensitive to methylation (MS-RDA). Rab6c was found to be underexpressed in MCF7/AdrR and MES-SA/Dx5 (an MDR human uterine sarcoma cell line) compared to their parental non-MDR cell lines. MCF7/AdrR cells expressing exogenous Rab6c showed less resistance to several anticancer drugs, such as doxorubicin (DOX), taxol, vinblastine, and vincristine, than control cells containing the empty vector. Flow cytometry experiments confirmed that the decreased resistance of transfectants to DOX was due to increased drug accumulation induced by exogenous Rab6c. These results indicate that Rab6c is involved in drug resistance in MCF7/AdrR cells.\n",
      "BACKGROUND: The calcineurin inhibitors cyclosporine and tacrolimus are both known to be nephrotoxic. Their use in orthotopic liver transplantation (OLTX) has significantly improved success rates. Recently, however, we have seen an increase in the number of patients presenting after OLTX with end-stage renal disease (ESRD). This retrospective study examines the incidence and treatment of ESRD and chronic kidney disease (CKD) in OLTX patients. METHODS: Patients who received OLTX only from June 1985 to December 1994 and survived 6 months postoperatively were studied (n = 834). Our prospectively collected database was the source of information. Patients were divided into three groups: controls, without CRF or ESRD, n = 748; CRF, sustained serum creatinine > 2.5 mg/dL, n = 41; and ESRD, n = 45. Groups were compared for preoperative laboratory variables, diagnosis, postoperative variables, survival, ESRD treatment type, and survival from ESRD initiation. RESULTS: 13 years after OLTX, the incidence of severe renal dysfunction was 18.1% (CRF 8.6% and ESRD 9.5%). Compared to control patients, CKD and ESRD patients had higher preoperative serum creatinine levels, a higher percentage of patients with hepatorenal syndrome, a higher percentage of dialysis requirements during the First 3 months postoperatively and higher serum creatinine at one year. A stepwise multivariate logistic regression analysis using preoperative and postoperative variables identified that an increase in serum creatinine above the mean at 1 year, 3 months, and 4 weeks postoperatively were independent risk factors for the development of CKD or ESRD with odds ratios of 2.6, 2.2, and 1.6, respectively. Overall survival from the time of OLTX was not significantly different between groups, but at year 13, survival for patients with ESRD was only 28.2%, compared to 54.6%. in the control group. Patients developing ESRD had a 6-year survival after the start of ESRD of 27% for hemodialysis patients compared to 71.4% for patients developing ESRD and subsequently receiving a kidney transplant. CONCLUSIONS: Patients who are more than 10 years post-OLTX have a high rate of CKD and ESRD. The development of ESRD decreases survival, particularly in patients treated with dialysis alone. Patients who develop ESRD have higher preoperative and one-year serum creatinine and are more likely to have hepatorenal syndrome. However, increased serum creatinine at different postoperative time points is more predictive of the development of CKD or ESRD. New long-term immunosuppression strategies may be necessary to reduce this complication.\n",
      "More than 100 different heterozygous mutations in copper/zinc superoxide dismutase (SOD1) have been discovered in patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), a fatal neurodegenerative disease. Uniquely, D90A-SOD1 was identified in recessive, dominant, and apparently sporadic pedigrees. The phenotype of homozygotes is stereotyped with prolonged survival, whereas that of affected heterozygotes varies. The frequency of D90A-SOD1 is 50 times higher in Scandinavia (2.5%) than elsewhere, although the prevalence of ALS is not high there. Our previous study indicated distinct founders for recessive and dominant/sporadic ALS and we proposed a disease-modifying factor linked to the recessive mutation. Here, we doubled our sample set and used new markers to characterize the origin of the mutation and locate any modifying factors. Linkage disequilibrium analysis indicates that D90A homozygotes and heterozygotes share a rare haplotype and are all descended from a single ancient founder (alpha 0.974) approximately 895 generations ago. Homozygotes subsequently appeared only about 63 generations ago (alpha 0.878). Recombination reduced the region shared by the recessive parents to 97-265 kb around SOD1, excluding all neighboring genes. We propose that a cis-acting regulatory polymorphism appeared close to D90A-SOD1 in the recessive founder, which decreases susceptibility to ALS in heterozygotes and slows disease progression.\n",
      "A large proportion of autosomal recessive non-syndromic deafness (NSARD) in many populations is caused by variants of the GJB2 gene. Here, the frequency of GJB2 variants was investigated in 406 and 183 apparently unrelated children from Kenya and Sudan, respectively, with predominantly severe to profound non-syndromic hearing loss. Nine (2.2%) Kenyan and 12 (6.6%) Sudanese children carried variants within the coding sequence of the GJB2 gene. Variants in the 5'-flanking region were detected in an additional 115 individuals. In total, 10 new variants were recognized, including four variants in the 5' adjacent region of exon 2 encoding GJB2 (g.3318-6T>A, g.3318-15C>T, g.3318-34C >T). , g.3318-35T>G), a deletion of 6 base pairs (g.3455_3460del [p.Asp46_Gln48delinsGlu]), a variant leading to a stop codon (g.3512C>A [p.Tyr65X]), synonymous variants (g.3395C>T [p.Thr26], g.3503C>T [p.Asn62], g.3627A>C [p.Arg104]), and a non-synonymous variant (g.3816C>A [p.Val167Met ]). Additionally, the previously described variants g.3352delG (commonly referred to as 30delG or 35 delG), g.3426G>A [p.Val37Ile], g.3697G>A [p.Arg127His], g.3774G>A [p.Val153Ile ] and g.3795G>A [p.Gly160Ser] were identified. With the exception of g.3318-34C>T and g.3352delG, all variants arose heterozygously. For most variants identified in the study population in Kenya and Sudan, a causal association with NSARD appears unlikely. Compared to many other ethnic groups, GJB2 coding region variants associated with deafness are rare in Sudan and Kenya, suggesting the role of other genetic or epigenetic factors as a cause of deafness in these countries.\n",
      "Fragile X syndrome is one of the most common causes of mental retardation in men, and patients with fragile X syndrome sometimes develop autism. It is usually caused by an expansion of the trinucleotide repeat in the 5' untranslated region of the FMR1 gene, but in a small number of patients, deletions and point mutations have been identified. We screened all 17 exons of the FMR1 gene for mutations in 90 autistic or mentally retarded children using single-strand conformational polymorphism (SSCP) analysis by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). No mutations were found in 76 male patients. However, one patient was heterozygous for one normal allele and one mutant allele with an A to C substitution at nucleotide 879 in exon 9. This mutation was not found in the 50 controls. Reverse transcription-PCR revealed that a large proportion of the mutant transcripts were aberrantly spliced, causing premature termination of protein synthesis. Although rare, point mutations in the FMR1 gene may be a cause of autism and mental retardation in Japanese patients.\n",
      "BACKGROUND: Long-term anti-cytomegalovirus (CMV) treatments in immunocompromised patients are hampered by resistance to antiviral drugs. Longitudinal changes in resistance genotype may depend on changes in selective pressure and complexity of CMV isolates. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate longitudinal changes in CMV resistance genotype and phenotype as well as strain-specific variability in a patient with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma in whom successive anti-CMV treatments have failed. STUDY DESIGN:The resistance phenotype and genotype of seven CMV isolates collected from one patient during a 2-year follow-up period were retrospectively analyzed. In parallel, we used glycoprotein B (gB) genotyping and a and UL10-13 sequence analysis to study CMV interstrain variability. RESULTS: The patient was infected with at least three strains of CMV as well as variants of the parental strains. Resistance to ganciclovir, cidofovir and foscarnet were successively detected during the follow-up period. Changes in the UL97 protein kinase responsible for resistance to ganciclovir were initially detected at residues 591 and 592, and then at position 594. The decrease in sensitivity to foscarnet coincided with the appearance of the N495K amino acid substitution in DNA polymerase, while cross-resistance to ganciclovir and cidofovir was due to substitution L501I. CONCLUSIONS: The CMV isolates obtained from our patient were complex mixtures of strains. Changes in resistance genotypes depended on resistance selective pressure and were not related to interstrain variation.\n",
      "Nijmegen breakage syndrome is a rare autosomal recessive chromosomal instability disorder characterized by early growth retardation, congenital microcephaly, immunodeficiency, borderline mental development, and a strong tendency toward lymphoreticular malignancies. Most patients with Nijmegen rupture syndrome are of Slavic origin and all known so far carry a homozygous founder deletion of 5 nucleotides in the NBS1 gene. Microcephaly was present in 100% of patients with Nijmegen rupture syndrome in a recent large international cooperative study. The frequency of Nijmegen rupture syndrome in children with primary microcephaly was not known. Correct and early diagnosis of the syndrome is crucial for appropriate preventive care and therapy. We tested 67 Czech patients of different ages with simple microcephaly for the presence of the most common mutation in the NBS1 gene. Three new cases of Nijmegen breakage syndrome were detected in this cohort, representing 4.5% of the cohort. All of these newly diagnosed Nijmegen rupture syndrome patients were younger than 10 months at the time of diagnosis. They were all born within a 2.5 year period. Twenty-three of the 67 children in the cohort were born during this 2.5-year period, representing a 13% incidence of Nijmegen rupture syndrome. The frequency of Nijmegen rupture syndrome heterozygotes in infants in the Czech Republic is 1: 130-158, and the birth rate is 90,000 per year. Therefore, within 2.5 years, three new Nijmegen rupture syndrome homozygotes are expected to be born. Therefore, we assume that through DNA testing of Czech primary microcephalic children it is possible to detect all expected patients of Nijmegen rupture syndrome. The age at correct diagnosis has been lowered from 7.1 years before DNA testing to well under a year. All new patients with Nijmegen breakage syndrome could benefit from tailored preventive care, which should significantly improve their life expectancy and prognosis.\n",
      "The authors describe the unusual association between diffuse gastric B-cell lymphoma and myotonic dystrophy, the most common form of adult muscular dystrophy, and sudden atrial fibrillation after a cycle of doxorubicin-based chemotherapy in the same patient. patient. Atrial fibrillation or other cardiac arrhythmias are unusual complications in patients treated with chemotherapy. The cardiac toxicity intrinsically associated with the aggressive chemotherapy used could function as a triggering factor for the arrhythmia in the predisposed myocardium of this patient.\n",
      "The aim of this study was to perform an analysis of the 5-alpha-reductase type 2 (SRD5A2) gene in a male pseudohermaphrodite (MPH) patient with normal testosterone (T) production and coding sequences for the gene. of the normal androgen receptor (AR). A patient of Chinese origin with ambiguous genitalia at 14 months, 46,XY karyotype and normal T secretion under human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) stimulation underwent gonadectomy at 20 months. Exons 1 to 8 of the AR gene and exons 1 to 5 of the SRD5A2 gene were sequenced from peripheral blood DNA. The AR gene coding sequences were normal. Analysis of the SRD5A2 gene revealed 2 consecutive mutations in exon 4, each located in a different allele: 1) a deletion of the T nucleotide, which predicts a frameshift mutation at codon 219, and 2) a missense mutation at codon 227, where the substitution of guanine (CGA) by adenine (CAA) predicts a replacement of arginine (R227Q) by glutamine. The testes located in the inguinal canal presented a normal morphology for age. The patient was a compound heterozygote for SRD5A2 mutations, carrying 2 mutations in exon 4. The patient had an R227Q mutation that has been described in an Asian population and MPH patients, as well as a novel frameshift mutation , Tdel219. Testis morphology showed that during infancy, 5-alpha-reductase enzyme deficiency may not have affected interstitial or tubular development.\n",
      "BACKGROUND: Gitelman syndrome (GS) is an autosomal recessive disorder resulting from inactivating mutations in the thiazide-sensitive Na-Cl co-transporter (NCCT) gene. To date, nearly 90 mutations have been identified. It is possible that there is a population-specific distribution of mutations. In this study, we analyzed the NCCT gene mutations of seven Japanese patients with GS. METHODS:Peripheral blood mononuclear cells were isolated from GS patients, their family members, and healthy control subjects. Mutation analysis of the NCCT gene was performed entirely by direct automated sequencing of polymerase chain reaction-amplified DNA products. In patients with splice site deletion or mutation, we undertook cDNA sequence analysis. RESULTS: We identified nine mutations. Five of them [c.185C>T (Thr60Met), c.1712C>T (Ala569Val), c.1930C>T (Arg642Cys), c.2552T>A (Leu849His) and c.1932delC] have been reported in Japanese patients. , but not in GS patients from other ethnic groups. The remaining four mutations [c.7A>T (Met1Leu), c.1181_1186+20del26, c.1811_1812delAT and IVS16+1G>A] were novel. In cDNA derived from a patient with c.1181_1186+20del26, a deletion of exon 9 and a frameshift at the beginning of exon 10 were observed. In cDNA derived from patients with IVS16+1G>A, an additional 96 bp insertion between exons 16 and 17 was observed. Six out of seven patients were compound heterozygotes, and the remainder carried a single heterozygous mutation. CONCLUSIONS: We found four novel mutations in the NCCT gene in seven Japanese patients with GS. Furthermore, our study suggests that the distribution of NCCT gene mutations in Japanese GS patients potentially differs from that in other populations.\n",
      "To study molecular defects in two Chinese pedigrees with hereditary factor V (FV) deficiency. A 37-year-old man (proband 1) and an 18-month-old boy (proband 2) were diagnosed with hereditary FV coagulation deficiency due to severe reduction in plasma FV activity and antigen levels. . The 25 exons and their flanking sequence of the F5 gene were amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for both candidates and the PCR products were directly sequenced. Total RNA was extracted from peripheral lymphocytes of proband 1 to detect changes at the mRNA level. The homozygous IVS8 -2A>G deletion was identified in the F5 gene of proband 1 and complementary DNA (cDNA) analysis revealed the abolition of the canonical splice site by mutation and activation of the site cryptic acceptor 24 bp upstream. The insertion introduced eight additional amino acids (AAs) into the FV protein. Two heterozygous mutations in the F5 gene were discovered in proband 2. AG 2238-9del in exon 13 introduced a premature termination code at 689 AA and substitution of G6410 with T in exon 23 led to the missense mutation Gly2079Val. Three F5 gene mutations, IVS8 -2A>G, 2238-9del AG and G6410T, were identified in two Chinese pedigrees with congenital FV deficiency, respectively.\n",
      "OBJECTIVE: To identify the genetic anomaly leading to congenital nuclear cataract affecting a large Swiss family of five generations. METHODS: Family history and clinical data were recorded. The phenotype was documented by both slit lamp and Scheimpflug photography. A cortical lens was evaluated by electron microscopy after cataract extraction. Lenticular phenotyping and genotyping were performed independently with short tandem repeat polymorphism. Linkage analysis was performed and candidate genes were amplified by PCR and screened for mutations on both strands by direct sequencing. RESULTS: Affected individuals had congenital lactescent nuclear cataract in both eyes. Linkage was observed on chromosome 17 for the DNA marker D17S1857 (ld score: 3.44 at theta = 0). Direct sequencing of CRYBA3/A1, which matches the neighborhood, revealed a 3 bp in-frame deletion of exon 4 (279delGAG). This mutation involved a deletion of glycine-91, segregated in all affected individuals, and was not observed in unaffected individuals or in 250 normal control subjects of the same ethnic origin. Electron microscopy showed that the morphology of the cortical lens fibers was normal. CONCLUSIONS: DeltaG91 mutation in CRYBA3/A1 is associated with autosomal dominant congenital nuclear lactescent cataract. A splice mutation (IVS3+1G/A) of this gene has been reported in zonular cataract with sutural opacities. These results indicate phenotypic heterogeneity linked to mutations in this gene.\n",
      "Alpers syndrome is a fatal neurogenetic disorder first described more than 70 years ago. It is an autosomal recessive developmental disorder of mitochondrial DNA depletion characterized by deficiency of mitochondrial DNA polymerase gamma (POLG) catalytic activity, refractory seizures, neurodegeneration, and liver disease. In two unrelated Alpers syndrome pedigrees, each affected child was found to carry a homozygous mutation in exon 17 of the POLG locus that led to a Glu873Stop mutation just upstream of the polymerase domain of the protein. Additionally, each affected child was heterozygous for the G1681A mutation in exon 7 which led to an Ala467Thr substitution in POLG, in the protein binding region.\n",
      "OBJECTIVE: To evaluate and characterize the risk of bladder cancer and its relationship with cyclophosphamide in patients with Wegener's granulomatosis. METHODS: From the Swedish National Inpatient Registry, a cohort of 1065 patients with Wegener's granulomatosis, 1969-95, was identified. Through linkage with the Swedish Cancer Registry, all subjects in this cohort diagnosed with bladder cancer were identified. Nested within the cohort, a matched case-control study was performed to estimate the association between cyclophosphamide and bladder cancer using odds ratios (OR) as relative risk. In the cohort, the cumulative risk of bladder cancer after Wegener's granulomatosis and the relative prevalence of a history of bladder cancer at the time of Wegener's granulomatosis diagnosis were also estimated. RESULTS: The median cumulative doses of cyclophosphamide among cases (n = 11) and controls (n = 25) were 113 g and 25 g, respectively. The risk of bladder cancer doubled for each 10 g increase in cyclophosphamide (OR = 2.0, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.8 to 4.9). Treatment duration greater than 1 year was associated with an eight-fold increased risk (OR = 7.7, 95% CI 0.9 to 69). The absolute risk of bladder cancer in the cohort reached 10% 16 years after Wegener's granulomatosis diagnosis, and a history of bladder cancer was (nonsignificantly) twice as common as expected at the time of diagnosis. diagnosis of Wegener's granulomatosis. CONCLUSION: Results indicate a dose-response relationship between cyclophosphamide and bladder cancer risk, high cumulative risks in the entire cohort, as well as the possibility that risk factors operate even before Wegener's granulomatosis .\n",
      "DiGeorge and velocardiofacial syndromes (DGS/VCFS) have a similar complex phenotype including cardiovascular, craniofacial and thymic malformations, and are associated with heterozygous deletions of chromosome band 22q11. The commonly deleted region of the 22q11.21 subband (here called TDR22) is very gene dense and the extent of deletion has been precisely defined in several studies. However, to date there is no evidence of a haploinsufficiency mechanism that can fully explain the DGS/VCFS phenotype. In this study, we show that the mapping of the candidate gene HIRA/Tuple1 to undeleted TDR22, in DGS/VCFS subjects, exhibits delayed replication timing. Furthermore, we observed an increase in the cell ratio showing the HIRA/Tuple1 locus localized towards the nuclear periphery. Replication timing and nuclear localization are known to generally correlate with the transcriptional activity of the relative DNA region. We propose that the altered replication/nuclear localization pattern of unsuppressed TDR22 indicates altered gene regulation, hence altered transcription in DGS/VCFS.\n",
      "Microfluorimetry and patch-clamp experiments were performed on HEK cells expressing TRPV6 to determine whether this Ca(2+)-sensing channel is constitutively active. Intact cells loaded with fura-2 had a high intracellular concentration of free Ca(2+) ((i)), which decreased to the same level as in untransfected cells if external Ca(2+) was chelated by the EGTA. Whole-cell recordings from untransfected HEK cells and cells expressing human TRPV6 revealed the presence of an inward basal current in both cell types when the internal solution contained 0.1 m m EGTA and 100 n m ( i) or if cytosolic Ca(2+) buffering is not disrupted in perforated patch-clamp experiments. If recombinantly expressed TRPV6 forms open channels, current Ca(2+)-mediated inhibition would be expected, as TRPV6 is negatively regulated by internal Ca(2+). However, dialysis of solutions with high concentration such as 1 microm in TRPV6-expressing cells did not block the inward basal current, which was no different from recordings from untransfected cells. In contrast, dialysis of 0.5 m m EGTA into TRPV6-expressing cells readily activated inward Ca(2+) currents, which were undetectable in untransfected cells. Interestingly, monovalent cations permeated TRPV6 channels under conditions where no Ca(2+) permeation was detectable, indicating that divalent cations block TRPV6 channels from the extracellular side. Like human TRPV6, truncated human TRPV6 (Delta695-725), lacking the C-terminal domain required for Ca(2+)-calmodulin binding, does not form constitutive active channels, whereas human TRPV6 (D542A) , carrying a point mutation in the presumed pore region, does not function as a channel. In summary, no constitutive open TRPV6 channels were detected in patch-clamp experiments from transfected HEK cells. However, channel activity is strongly regulated by intracellular and extracellular divalent cations.\n",
      "Resistance to thyroid hormone syndrome (RTH) is a rare disease, generally transmitted in an autosomal dominant manner. Patients with RTH are usually euthyroid but may occasionally present with signs and symptoms of thyrotoxicosis or rarely hypothyroidism. Affected individuals are usually heterozygous for mutations in the thyroid hormone receptor beta (TR-beta) gene. We present a patient with RTH homo-/hemizygous for a mutation in the TR-beta gene. The single nucleotide substitution I280S (1123T-->G) was present either on both alleles or in a hemizygous form with complete deletion of the second allele. The I280S mutation was recently reported in a heterozygous patient. The severe phenotype with severely impaired intellectual development, hyperkinetic behavior, tachycardia, hearing and visual impairment is likely due to the dominant negative effect of the mutant I280S protein and the absence of any functional TR-beta.\n",
      "Endothelin-1 (ET-1) is a potent vasoconstrictor and exhibits diverse pharmacological responses. Two single nucleotide polymorphisms in the ET-1 (EDN1) gene have been reported to be associated with blood pressure (BP). One of them is the Lys198Asn polymorphism, which showed a positive association with blood pressure in overweight people. Another is the 3A/4A (-134delA) polymorphism located in the 5' untranslated region. In this study, we investigated the expression of the Lys198Asn polymorphism in ET-1 in vitro, as well as the association between either of the two polymorphisms and plasma ET-1 level. We expressed both major (Lys-type) and minor (Asn-type) preproET-1 in three different cell lines, and measured the levels of ET-1 and big ET-1 in the culture supernatant. There was no significant difference in the levels of ET-1 or big ET-1 between the Asn-type and Lys-type transfectant. In the combination study, plasma ET-1 levels in 54 hypertensive patients with an amino acid substitution of Lys for Asn at position 198 were not different from those in hypertensives without the substitution. However, we found a significant difference in ET-1 levels between individuals carrying the 3A/3A and 3A/4A genotypes. Our transient expression study indicates that the Lys198Asn polymorphism may not directly affect ET-1 and significant ET-1 production. Another variant of the EDN1 gene in linkage disequilibrium with the Lys198Asn polymorphism may be responsible for the association with BP, or the interaction between the EDN1 Lys198Asn polymorphism and other factors such as obesity may be involved in the mechanisms increasing BP in vivo.\n",
      "BACKGROUND: Primary vesicoureteral reflux (VUR) is an inherited disorder characterized by retrograde flow of urine through the ureters and kidneys. It affects around 1% of young children and is therefore one of the most common hereditary diseases. The associated nephropathy is an important cause of end-stage renal failure in children and adults. Recent studies indicate that genetic ablation of the mouse uroplakin (UP) III gene, which encodes a 47 kD urothelial-specific integral membrane protein forming urothelial plaques, causes VUR and hydronephrosis. METHODS: To begin to determine whether mutations in the UP genes might play a role in human VUR, we genotyped the four UP genes in 76 patients with radiologically proven primary VUR by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification and sequencing of all their exons plus 50 to 150 bp of flanking intronic sequences. RESULTS: Eighteen single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were identified, seven of which were missense, without truncation or frameshift mutations. Because healthy relatives of VUR probands are not reliable negative controls for VUR, we used a population of 90 healthy, race-matched individuals, unrelated to VUR patients, as controls to perform a study of VUR. 'association. Most SNPs were not found to be significantly associated with VUR. However, SNP1 of the UP Ia gene affecting a C to T conversion and an Ala7Val change, and SNP7 of UP III affecting a C to G conversion and a Pro154Ala change, were marginally associated with VUR (both P = 0.08). Additional case studies yielded a second set of data that, in combination with the first set, confirmed a weak association of UP III SNP7 in VUR (adjusted P = 0.036 for both subsets of cases versus controls ). CONCLUSION: Such a weak association and the absence of families with simple dominant Mendelian inheritance suggest that missense changes in uroplakin genes may not play a dominant role in the occurrence of VUR in humans, although that they may constitute weak risk factors contributing to a complex polygenic disease. The fact that no truncation or frameshift mutations were found in any of the VUR patients, coupled with our recent discovery that some breeding pairs of UP III knockout mice yield litters that not only exhibit VUR , but also severe hydronephrosis and neonatal death, raises the possibility that major mutations in uroplakin could be embryonic or postnatal lethal in humans.\n",
      "Crataegus tincture (TCR), an alcoholic extract of hawthorn berries (Crataegus oxycantha), is used in herbal medicine and homeopathy. The present study was carried out to investigate the protective effect of TCR on experimentally induced myocardial infarction in rats. TCR pretreatment, at a dose of 0.5 mL/100 g body weight per day, orally for 30 days, prevented the increase in lipid peroxidation and marker enzyme activity observed in rats induced by isoproterenol (85 mg kg(-1) s.c. for 2 days at 24 hour intervals). TCR prevented the isoproterenol-induced decrease in antioxidant enzymes in the heart and increased the ADP-stimulated oxygen uptake rate and respiratory coupling ratio. TCR protected against isoproterenol-induced pathological changes in the rat heart. The results show that pretreatment with TCR may be useful in preventing isoproterenol-induced damage in the rat heart.\n",
      "The antioxidant enzyme paraoxonase 1 (PON1) has previously been suggested to confer protection against coronary heart disease (CHD), one of the leading causes of death in the Western world. Two coding polymorphisms, 55M/L and 192Q/R, as well as a promoter variant, -107C/T, have been studied extensively with respect to susceptibility to coronary heart disease. In this study, we investigated the impact of these three polymorphisms on mortality using a sample of 1,932 Danish individuals aged 47–93 years, previously used in studies of genetic longevity. A cross-sectional study comparing the genotype distribution of the three polymorphisms separately as well as the haplotype distribution in different age groups revealed no differences. However, a follow-up longitudinal survival study in the same sample indicated that 192RR homozygotes have poorer survival than QQ homozygotes (hazard ratio: 1.38, P = 0.04). We then used an independent sample of 541 Danish individuals from the oldest cohort and confirmed the initial results (hazard ratio: 1.38, P = 0.09). In both samples, the effect was more pronounced among women. Using self-reported ischemic heart disease data to assess the impact of the PON 192Q/R polymorphism on coronary heart disease susceptibility, we found only a non-significant trend that 192RR homozygosity in women was a factor. of risk. Our results thus indicate that PON1 192RR homozygosity is associated with increased mortality in women in the second half of life and that this increased mortality is perhaps linked to the severity of coronary heart disease and survival after illness. coronary heart disease rather than susceptibility to the development of coronary heart disease.\n",
      "There is concern that the risk of cardiovascular thrombotic events may be higher with specific cyclooxygenase (COX)-2 inhibitors than with nonselective nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). We evaluated data on cardiovascular events related to valdecoxib, a novel specific COX-2 inhibitor, in approximately 8,000 patients with osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis treated with this agent in randomized clinical trials. The incidence of cardiovascular thrombotic events (cardiac, cerebrovascular and peripheral vascular or arterial thrombotic events) was determined by analyzing a pool of valdecoxib (10 to 80 mg daily), non-selective NSAIDs (diclofenac 75 mg bid, ibuprofen 800 mg tid or naproxen 500 mg bid ) and placebo data from 10 trials. randomized studies on osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis covering 6 to 52 weeks duration. Incidence rates of events were determined in all patients (n = 7,934) and in low-dose aspirin users (< or = 325 mg daily) (n = 1,051) and in non- aspirin users (n = 6,883). Crude and exposure-adjusted incidences of thrombotic events were similar for valdecoxib, NSAIDs, and placebo. The risk of serious thrombotic events was also similar for each dose of valdecoxib. Thrombotic risk was consistently higher among aspirin users than among non-aspirin users (placebo, 1.4% versus 0%; valdecoxib, 1.7% versus 0.2%; NSAIDs, 1.9 % versus 0.5%). Event rates among aspirin users were similar for the 3 treatment groups and for all doses of valdecoxib. Short- and medium-term treatment with therapeutic (10 or 20 mg daily) and supratherapeutic (40 or 80 mg daily) doses of valdecoxib was not associated with an increased incidence of thrombotic events compared to NSAIDs. non-selective or placebo in patients suffering from osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis. controlled clinical trials.\n",
      "We previously reported an association of FCGR2B-Ile232Thr with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) in three Asian populations. Since polymorphism in CD72, another inhibitory B-cell receptor, was associated with murine SLE, we identified human CD72 polymorphisms, tested their association with SLE, and examined genetic interaction with FCGR2B in Japanese ( 160 LED, 277 witnesses), the Thais (87 LED). , 187 controls) and Caucasians (94 families containing SLE members). Four polymorphisms and six rare variations were detected. The first constituted two major haplotypes containing one or two repeats of 13 nucleotides in intron 8 (designated *1 and *2, respectively). Although no association with SLE susceptibility was detected, the *1 allele was significantly associated with nephritis in Japanese patients (P = 0.024). RT-PCR identified a novel alternatively spliced ​​(AS) transcript expressed at the protein level in COS-7 transfectants. The AS/common isoform ratio was significantly increased in individuals with *2/*2 genotype compared to *1/*1 (P=0.000038) or *1/*2 (P=0.0085) genotypes. Using the two Asian cohorts, a significant association of FCGR2B-232Thr/Thr with SLE was observed only in the presence of the CD72-*1/*1 genotype (OR 4.63, 95% CI 1.47-14, 6, P=0.009 versus FCGR2B-232Ile/Ile plus CD72-*2/*2). Minigene analyzes demonstrated that the repetition of 13 nucleotides and the deletion of 4 bp within the same haplotype of intron 8 could regulate alternative splicing. The AS isoform lacks exon 8 and is inferred to contain 49 amino acid changes in the membrane-distal portion of the extracellular domain, where considerable amino acid changes are known in the associated CD72(c) allele to murine LED. These results indicated that the presence of the CD72-*2 allele decreases the risk of human SLE conferred by FCGR2B-232Thr, possibly by increasing the AS isoform of CD72.\n",
      "Disseminated superficial actinic porokeratosis (DSAP) is a rare autosomal dominant chronic keratinization disorder characterized by multiple superficial keratotic lesions surrounded by a slightly raised keratotic border. So far, although two DSAP loci have been identified, the genetic basis and pathogenesis of this disorder have not yet been elucidated. In this study, we performed genome-wide linkage analysis in three affected Chinese families and located the gene within an 8.0 cM interval defined by D12S330 and D12S354 on chromosome 12. When screening 30 genes candidates, we identified a missense mutation, p.Ser63Asn. in SSH1 in one family, a frameshift mutation, p.Ser19CysfsX24 in an alternative variant (isoform f) of SSH1 in another family and a frameshift mutation, p.Pro27ProfsX54 in the same alternative variant in a case unfamiliar with DSAP. SSH1 encodes a phosphatase that plays a central role in actin dynamics. Our data suggest that cytoskeletal disorganization in epidermal cells is likely associated with the pathogenesis of DSAP.\n",
      "BACKGROUND: A dengue type 2 virus (DEN-2 Tonga/74) isolated from a 1974 outbreak was characterized by mild disease and belongs to the American genotype of DEN-2 viruses. To prepare a vaccine candidate, a previously described 30-nucleotide deletion (Delta30) in the 3' untranslated region of DEN-4 was modified in isolate DEN-2. METHODS:A full-length cDNA clone was generated from DEN-2 virus and used to produce recombinant DEN-2 (rDEN-2) and rDEN2Delta30. Virus replication was assessed in SCID mice transplanted with human hepatoma cells (SCID-HuH-7 mice), in mosquitoes, and in rhesus monkeys. Induction of neutralizing antibodies and protective efficacy were also evaluated in rhesus monkeys. RESULTS: Replication of rDEN2Delta30 virus was reduced tenfold in SCID-HuH-7 mice compared to the parent virus. The rDEN-2 viruses were not infectious to Aedes mosquitoes, but both Toxorynchites mosquitoes were easily infected. In rhesus monkeys, rDEN2Delta30 appeared to be slightly attenuated compared to the parent virus, as measured by the duration and peak of viremia and induction of neutralizing antibodies. A derivative of rDEN2Delta30, named rDEN2Delta30-4995, was generated by incorporation of a previously identified point mutation in the NS3 gene of DEN-4 and was found to be more attenuated than rDEN2Delta30 in SCID-HuH-7 mice. CONCLUSIONS: The rDEN2Delta30 and rDEN2Delta30-4995 viruses may be considered for evaluation in humans and for inclusion in a tetravalent dengue vaccine.\n",
      "BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES: Interleukin-12 (IL-12) governs the Th1-type immune response, affecting spontaneous and treatment-induced recovery after HCV infection. We investigated whether IL12B polymorphisms in the promoter region (4 bp insertion/deletion) and the 3'-UTR (1188-A/C), which are thought to influence IL-12 synthesis, were associated following HCV infection. . METHODS: We analyzed 186 individuals with spontaneous HCV clearance, 501 patients chronically infected with HCV, and 217 healthy controls. Genotyping of IL12B 3'-UTR and promoter was performed by Taqman-based assays with allele-specific oligonucleotide probes and allele-specific DNA amplification by PCR, respectively. RESULTS: The proportion of IL12B promoter and 3'-UTR genotypes did not differ significantly between the different cohorts. However, HCV genotype 1-infected patients with high baseline viremia and carrying the IL12B 3'-UTR 1188-C allele had significantly higher sustained virologic response (SVR) rates (25.3% compared to 46% versus 54.5% for A/A, A/C, and C/C) due to reduced relapse rates (24.2% versus 12% versus zero% for A/A, A/C, and C/C). CONCLUSIONS: Carriers of the IL12B 3'-UTR 1188-C allele appear to be able to respond more effectively to combination antiviral therapy due to a reduced relapse rate. No association between IL12B polymorphisms and self-limited HCV infection could be demonstrated.\n",
      "OBJECTIVE: Congenital long QT syndrome (LQTS) with in utero onset of rhythm disturbances is associated with a poor prognosis. In this study, we investigated a neonate with fetal bradycardia, 2:1 atrioventricular block, and ventricular tachycardia shortly after birth. METHODS: Mutational analysis and DNA sequencing were performed in a neonate. 2:1 atrioventricular block improved to 1:1 conduction only after intravenous infusion of lidocaine or high dose mexiletine, which also controlled ventricular tachycardia. RESULTS: A novel spontaneous LQTS-3 mutation was identified in transmembrane segment 6 of domain IV of the cardiac Na(v)1.5 sodium channel, with a G-->A substitution at codon 1763, which altered a valine (GTG) to a methionine (ATG). The proband was heterozygous but the mutation was absent in the parents and sister. Expression of this mutant channel in tsA201 mammalian cells by site-directed mutagenesis revealed a persistent current sensitive to tetrodotoxin but resistant to lidocaine, associated with a positive shift in the steady-state inactivation curve, a steeper activation curve and faster recovery after inactivation. We also found a similar electrophysiological profile for the neighboring mutant V1764M. But the other neighboring I1762A mutant had no persistent current and was always associated with a positive inactivation shift. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that Na(v)1.5/V1763M channel dysfunction and possible neighboring mutants contribute to persistent inward current due to altered inactivation kinetics and clinically congenital LQTS with perinatal onset d arrhythmias responding to lidocaine and mexiletine.\n",
      "Beta-adrenergic receptors (beta-AR) are G protein-coupled receptors activated by epinephrine and norepinephrine and are involved in various physiological functions. Previously, three beta-AR genes (ADRB1, ADRB2, and ADRB3) were resequenced, identifying polymorphisms used in genetic association studies of cardiovascular and metabolic disorders. These studies produced intriguing but inconsistent results, likely because the known functional variants: ADRB1 Arg389Gly and Gly49Ser, ADRB2 Arg16Gly and Gln27Glu, and ADRB3 Arg64Trp provided an incomplete picture of the total functional diversity of these genes. Therefore, we created marker panels for each beta-AR gene including the known functional markers as well as other markers regularly spaced and with sufficient density to identify haplotype block structure and maximize haplotype diversity. A total of 27 markers were genotyped in 96 Caucasian Americans and 96 African Americans. In both populations and for each gene, a single block with little evidence of historical recombination was observed. For each gene, the haplotype captured most of the information content of each functional locus, even if that locus was not genotyped, and it is likely that the haplotype would capture signal from unknown functional loci whose alleles are d moderate abundance. This study demonstrates the utility of using beta-AR gene haplotype maps and marker panels as tools for linkage studies of beta-AR function.\n",
      "Despite the growing need to identify and quantify tissue oxygenation at the cellular level, relatively few methods are available. In this study, we developed a novel hypoxia-responsive reporter vector using a hypoxia-responsive element of the vascular endothelial growth factor 5' untranslated region and generated a novel hypoxia-sensing transgenic rat. We then applied this animal model to the detection of tubulointerstitial hypoxia in the diseased kidney. With this model, we were able to identify diffuse cortical hypoxia in puromycin aminonucleoside-induced nephrotic syndrome and focal and segmental hypoxia in the remnant kidney model. Expression of the hypoxia-responsive transgene increased throughout the observation period, reaching 2.2-fold at 2 weeks in the puromycin aminonucleoside model and 2.6-fold at 4 weeks in the remnant kidney model. , while that of vascular endothelial growth factor showed a slight decrease. reflecting distinct behaviors of the two genes. The degree of hypoxia showed a positive correlation with microscopic tubulointerstitial damage in both models. Finally, we identified the localization of nuclear proliferating antigen-positive, ED-1-positive, terminally tagged-positive cells with the dUTP terminus in the hypoxic cortical area of ​​the remnant kidney model. We propose here a possible pathological link between chronic tubulointerstitial hypoxia and progressive glomerular diseases.\n",
      "Breast cancer accounts for 30-40% of all cancer deaths among women. In an effort to identify tumor-associated antigens that could be useful for immunotherapy, we used the serological analysis of recombinant cDNA expression libraries (SEREX) technique to identify cancer-associated antigens. breast. SEREX screening of cDNA expression libraries derived from 3 breast cancer patients identified a total of 88 positive clones (bcg-1 to bcg-88), including 27 previously unknown sequences. The cDNA sequences and mRNA expression patterns were characterized. Seroreactivity of SEREX clones was determined in the sera of 75 breast cancer patients, 75 colon cancer patients and 25 healthy donors. Expression analysis on a panel of cDNAs from 17 different normal tissues by reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) revealed tissue-restricted mRNA expression of 2 of 27 unknown antigens. Bcg-72 is expressed only in the breast, prostate and thymus, while Bcg-84 is expressed at moderate levels in the testis, spleen and breast. The other 25 unknown antigens were expressed in most other tissues. Serological analysis revealed that 7 of 88 clones showed reactivity to at least one serum from 75 breast cancer patients or 75 colon cancer patients. These clones did not react with sera from a panel of 25 healthy adult individuals. Our results demonstrate the utility of the SEREX approach for the identification of potential tumor-associated antigens in human breast cancer.\n",
      "BACKGROUND: Recent data suggest that prostate-specific antigen (PSA) polymorphisms may increase the risk of prostate cancer (PC). The PSA gene contains a G/A substitution in region 1 of the androgen response element (ARE). The androgen receptor (AR) gene has polymorphic regions containing glutamine and glycine repeats of variable length and these are thought to be associated with CP risk. The effect on PC risks of PSA polymorphisms alone and in synergy with the AR gene was examined in this report. METHODS: One hundred CP patients and an age-matched cohort consisting of 79 benign prostatic hyperplasia patients and 67 population controls were included in this study. DNA was extracted from blood and the PSA/ARE promoter region amplified by PCR. PCR products were cut with the restriction enzyme Nhe 1 to distinguish G/A alleles. The length of AR/CAG and GGC repeats was detected by automated fluorescence from PCR products. RESULTS: We found a significantly higher PSA/GG distribution in PC (30%) than in benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) (18%) or control population (16%) (P = 0.025) . Furthermore, the distribution of GG within cases was even greater in younger men (<65 years; 42%; P = 0.012). Additionally, when PSA genotype was cross-classified with CAG repeat, significantly more cases than BPH and control population with short (<22) CAG/GG genotype were observed (P = 0.006). CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate that the PSA/ARE GG genotype confers an increased risk of CP, particularly in younger men. Furthermore, we confirm previous results that short glutamine repeat in conjunction with GG genotype significantly increases the risk of malignant disease.\n",
      "A 14-year-old girl suffers from recurrent acute interstitial nephritis, induced by azithromycin. The second episode was more serious than the first; and although both were treated with intensive corticosteroid therapy, renal function remained impaired.

      "Bernard-Soulier syndrome (BSS) is a rare hereditary bleeding disorder caused by quantitative or qualitative abnormalities of the platelet glycoprotein (GP) Ib/IX/V complex, the main receptor for von Willebrand factor. The complex includes four subunits, each encoded by a distinct gene. Several mutations have been described for each of the subunits, except GPV, as a cause of BSS. Here we describe the genetic basis of the disorder in a child with BSS. Flow cytometric analysis of the patient's platelets showed markedly reduced surface expression of all three glycoproteins of the GPIb/IX/V complex. DNA sequencing analysis showed that the patient was a compound heterozygote for two mutations in the GPIX gene, a novel nine-nucleotide deletion beginning at position 1952 of the gene that changes asparagine 86 to alanine and removes acids amino acids 87, 88, and 89 (arginine, threonine, and proline) and a previously reported point mutation that changes the asparagine codon (AAC) to serine (AGC) at residue 45. His mother was heterozygous for the Asn45Ser mutation, and his father, for the deletion of nine nucleotides. Our results suggest that the additive effects of the two GPIX gene mutations are responsible for the patient's BSS phenotype.\n",
      "BACKGROUND: Although the incidence of new-onset diabetes mellitus may increase in patients with schizophrenia treated with certain atypical antipsychotic agents, it remains unclear whether atypical agents directly affect glucose metabolism or simply increase glucose metabolism. known risk factors for diabetes. OBJECTIVE: To study the 2 drugs most clearly involved (clozapine and olanzapine) and risperidone using a frequently sampled intravenous glucose tolerance test. DESIGN: A cross-sectional design in stable, treated patients with schizophrenia, assessed using a frequently sampled intravenous glucose tolerance test and Bergman minimal model analysis. SETTING: Subjects were recruited from an urban community mental health clinic and were studied at a general clinical research center. Patients Fifty subjects signed informed consent and 41 underwent the frequently sampled intravenous glucose tolerance test. Thirty-six non-obese subjects with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder, matched for body mass index and treated with either clozapine, olanzapine or risperidone, were included in the analysis. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Fasting plasma glucose and fasting serum insulin levels, insulin sensitivity index, homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance, and glucose efficiency. RESULTS: The mean +/- SD duration of treatment with the identified atypical antipsychotic agent was 68.3 +/- 28.9 months (clozapine), 29.5 +/- 17.5 months (olanzapine), and 40. 9 +/- 33.7 (risperidone). Fasting serum insulin concentrations differed between groups (F(33) = 3.35; P = 0.047) (clozapine > olanzapine > risperidone) with significant differences between clozapine and risperidone (t(33) = 2 .32; P = 0.03) and olanzapine and risperidone (t (33) = 2.15; P = 0.04). There was a significant difference in insulin sensitivity index between groups (F(33) = 10.66; P < 0.001) (clozapine < olanzapine < risperidone), subjects who received clozapine and olanzapine showing significant insulin resistance compared to risperidone-treated subjects (clozapine vs risperidone, t(33) = -4.29; P < 0.001; olanzapine vs risperidone, t(33) = -3.62 ; P = 0.001 [P<0.001]). Homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance also differed significantly between groups (F(33) = 4.92; P = 0.01) (clozapine > olanzapine > risperidone) (clozapine vs risperidone , t(33) = 2.94; P = 0.006; olanzapine vs. risperidone, t(33) = 2.42; There was a significant difference between groups in glucose efficacy (F(30) = 4.18; P = 0.02) (clozapine < olanzapine < risperidone) with significant differences between clozapine and risperidone ( t (30) = -2.59; P = 0.02). ) and olanzapine and risperidone (t(30) = -2.34, P = 0.03). CONCLUSIONS: Non-obese groups treated with clozapine and olanzapine showed significant insulin resistance and decreased glucose efficiency compared to subjects treated with risperidone. Patients taking clozapine and olanzapine should be evaluated for insulin resistance and its consequences.\n",
      "Ten primary central nervous system lymphomas (PCNSL, cerebral lymphomas) were screened for deletion, mutation and methylation of exon 1beta of the p14 gene by Southern blot analysis, nucleotide chain reaction clone analysis by polymerase and Southern blot methylation assay. In Southern blot analysis, based on the signal densities of the hybridized bands and their similarities to those of exons 2 and 3 in our previous quantitative study, we found that exon 1beta was homozygously deleted in four cases, hemizygously deleted in five cases and not deleted in one case. Thus, the same deletion patterns covered the entire p14 gene in all but one case, which suggested hemizygous deletion of exons 1beta and 2 and homozygous deletion of exon 3. Additionally, although Exon 1beta mutation is rare in various tumors, we detected a missense mutation (L50R) in one case with a hemizygous deletion. Methylation of the 5'CpG island of the p14 gene has in no case been suggested without homozygous deletion. Our observation of frequent p14 gene abnormalities (90%) and inactivation (40-60%) contrasted strikingly with the same pathological subtype of systemic lymphoma in which p14 gene abnormalities and inactivation were minimal. frequent, suggesting a difference in carcinogenesis between PCNSL and systemic. lymphoma.\n",
      "The HH genotype of the non-conservative amino acid substitution polymorphism N372H in the BRCA2 gene was reported to be associated with a 1.3- to 1.5-fold increase in breast and ovarian cancer risk. These studies focused on sporadic cancer cases, we examined whether N372H and another common variant located in the 5' untranslated region (203G > A) of the BRCA2 gene modified the risk of breast or ovarian cancer in carriers of the BRCA1 mutation. The study included 778 women carrying a germline BRCA1 mutation belonging to 403 families. The two BRCA2 variants were analyzed by the TaqMan allelic discrimination technique. Genotypes were analyzed by disease-free survival analysis using a Cox proportional hazards model. We found no evidence of a significant change in breast cancer penetrance in BRCA1 mutation carriers by either polymorphism. Regarding the risk of ovarian cancer, we also saw no effect with the N372H variant, but we observed a borderline association with the 203A allele of the 5' untranslated region (risk ratio, 1.43; CI, 1.01-2.00). Contrary to the results of Healey et al. on neonatal females and control adult females, we found no deviation from Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium in the distribution of N372H alleles for our BRCA1-carrying females. We conclude that if these single nucleotide polymorphisms do modify cancer risk in BRCA1 mutation carriers, their effects are not significantly greater than those of N372H previously observed in the general population.\n",
      "We investigated the relationship between spinal motor neuron degeneration and N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) receptor activation following neuraxial morphine following a non-injurious interval of aortic occlusion in rats. Spinal cord ischemia was induced by aortic occlusion for 6 minutes with a balloon catheter. In a microdialysis study, 10 µL of saline (group C; n = 8) or 30 mug of morphine (group M; n = 8) were injected intrathecally (IT) 0.5 h after reflow, and 30 mug of morphine (SM group; n = 8) or 10 µL of saline (SC group; n = 8) were injected IT 0.5 h later the fictitious operation. Microdialysis samples were collected before ischemia, before IT injection, and at 2, 4, 8, 24, and 48 h of reperfusion (after IT injection). Second, we investigated the effect of IT MK-801 (30 mugs) on histopathological changes in the spinal cord after morphine-induced spastic paraparesis. After IT morphine, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) glutamate concentration increased in group M compared with baseline and group C (P < 0.05). This increase persisted for 8 hours. IT MK-801 significantly reduced the number of black-stained alpha motor neurons after morphine-induced spastic paraparesis compared with the saline group. These data indicate that IT morphine induces spastic paraparesis with a concomitant increase in CSF glutamate, involved in NMDA receptor activation. We suggest that opioids could be neurotoxic in the context of spinal cord ischemia via activation of the NMDA receptor.\n",
      "Amiodarone represents an effective antiarrhythmic drug for cardioversion of new-onset atrial fibrillation (AF) and maintenance of sinus rhythm. We briefly describe two patients with new-onset atrial fibrillation who experienced acute and devastating low back pain within minutes of starting intravenous amiodarone loading. Notably, this side effect has never been reported in the medical literature. Clinicians should be aware of this reaction since rapid cessation of parenteral administration leads to complete resolution.\n",
      "Exposure to solar radiation, particularly its ultraviolet (UV) B component, has various harmful effects on human health. Some of these effects include sunburn cell formation, basal and squamous cell cancers, melanoma, cataracts, photoaging of the skin, and immune suppression. Among these various harmful effects of UV rays, skin cancer is the most worrying. Over the years, lifestyle changes have led to a significant increase in the amount of UV radiation received, leading to an increase in the incidence of skin cancer. Skin cancer development is a complex, multistage phenomenon involving three distinct stages illustrated by the stages of initiation, promotion, and progression. Each of these steps is mediated by alterations in various cellular, biochemical and molecular changes. Initiation, the first step in the process of carcinogenesis, is essentially an irreversible step during which genetic alterations occur in genes, ultimately leading to DNA modification and fixation of the mutation. Tumor promotion is the essential process of cancer development involving the clonal expansion of initiated cells giving rise to pre-cancerous and then malignant lesions, mainly through alteration of signal transduction pathways. Tumor progression involves the conversion of precancerous and malignant lesions into an invasive and potentially metastatic malignancy. All these processes of skin cancer development involve stimulation of DNA synthesis, DNA damage and proliferation, inflammation, immunosuppression, epidermal hyperplasia, cell cycle dysregulation, depletion of antioxidant defenses, impairment of signal transduction pathways, induction of cyclooxygenase, increased prostaglandin synthesis and induction of ornithine decarboxylase. Photochemoprevention has been appreciated as a viable approach to reduce the occurrence of skin cancer and, in recent years, the use of agents, particularly botanical antioxidants, present in the common diet and beverages consumed by the human population, have attracted considerable attention as photochemopreventive agents for human use. . Many of these agents have also found their way into skin care products. Although it is more common in Eastern countries, its popularity is increasing significantly in Western countries. In this article, we summarize the available information on laboratory studies of UVB-mediated signaling that can be exploited as targets for photochemoprevention. We suggest that the use of skin care products supplemented with proven chemopreventive agents, in conjunction with sunscreen use and educational efforts, could be an effective strategy to reduce UV-induced photodamage and skin cancer in men. The mechanistic bases for the use of such products are discussed.\n",
      "BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: The low prevalence of the C282Y mutation of the HFE gene in Japan means that the genetic background of hemochromatosis in Japanese patients remains unclear. In a previous report, we showed that 3 patients from the same family presented an AVAQ 594-597 deletion of the transferrin receptor gene (TfR2). This suggests that the TfR2 gene is involved in hemochromatosis in Japanese patients. DESIGN AND METHODS:Nine patients clinically diagnosed with hemochromatosis were included in the study. DNA was extracted from whole blood samples collected with informed consent. The HFE and TfR2 genes were analyzed by sequencing the coding region and splice sites. RESULTS: There were no mutations in the HFE gene. In the TfR2 gene, 2 new mutations, 1469T->G (L490R) and 1665delC (V561X), were found in 2 patients. A known variation, 714C->(I238M), was also found in the patient with L490R. The patient homozygous for L490R and I238M presented a mild manifestation of hemochromatosis at the age of 41 years. His liver was cirrhotic with parenchymal iron deposits and the result of a blood glucose test was consistent with diabetes mellitus. The patient homozygous for V561X presented with severe iron overload with the triad of cirrhosis, diabetes mellitus and skin pigmentation at the age of 58 years. INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS: In conjunction with the previous report, 5 of our 12 patients with hemochromatosis manifesting in middle age had mutations in the TfR2 gene. Thus, TfR2 plays a role in the pathogenesis of hemochromatosis in Japan.\n",
      "Primary hyperparathyroidism (pHPT) is a common endocrine disease that in more than 95% of cases is sporadic and is only in some cases caused by hereditary disorders, isolated or as part of multiple endocrine neoplasia (MEN1 and 2). Somatic mutations in the MEN1 gene have also been described in sporadic parathyroid tumors. In our study, we examined the presence of alterations of the MEN1 gene in a series of 39 patients operated on for sporadic pHPT (35 with parathyroid adenoma or hyperplasia, 4 with carcinoma). A genotype-phenotype correlation was also analyzed. After extraction of DNA from paraffin-embedded tissues, we PCR amplified and sequenced exons 2 to 10 of the MEN1 gene. Somatic MEN1 mutations were detected in 6 of 35 patients with benign parathyroid lesions examined (17.1%), whereas no alterations were found in the carcinomas. Four novel mutations in the MEN1 gene were identified as follows: a frameshift mutation (222insT, exon 2), a frameshift deletion (912delTA, exon 5), an in-frame deletion (835del18, exon 4), and a missense mutation (P291A, exon 6). ). Additionally, a missense mutation (L89R, exon 2) and a nonsense mutation (Q536X, exon 10) were previously reported. Additionally, two polymorphisms were also found: one allele carried an R171Q polymorphism (1/39 tumors), while a D418D (GAC/GAT) polymorphism was found in 15 and 8 tumors in heterozygosity (CT) and homozygosity (TT), respectively. In no case (mutations and/or polymorphisms) did we find a genotype-phenotype correlation. In conclusion, our data demonstrate the presence of somatic alterations of the MEN1 tumor suppressor gene in approximately one fifth of sporadic benign parathyroid tumors. The absence of genotype-phenotype correlation, however, suggests the involvement of other genetic/epigenetic factors in the full expression of the disease.\n",
      "BACKGROUND: Folate is essential for cell division, a major hallmark of in utero development. Dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) is necessary to convert folic acid used in supplements and for food enrichment and dihydrofolate produced by thymidylate synthase during DNA synthesis to the reduced folate forms used by the cell. OBJECTIVE: We sought to determine whether a recently discovered common deletion polymorphism in the DHFR gene is a risk factor for preterm delivery or low birth weight. DESIGN: We studied 324 pregnant women from Camden, NJ. Folate intake was calculated from folate supplement intake plus the average of two 24-hour boosters taken during pregnancy. Genomic DNA was extracted from women's leukocytes and genotyped. RESULTS: Women with a deletion allele had a significantly higher risk of preterm birth [adjusted odds ratio (AOR): 3.0; 95% CI: 1.0, 8.8; P < 0.05] than those without deletion allele. Women with both a DHFR deletion allele and low folate intake (<400 microg/d from diet and supplements) had a significantly higher risk of preterm birth (AOR: 5.5; CI at 95%: 1.5, 20.4; P = 0.01) and a significantly higher risk of premature birth. higher risk of having an infant with low birth weight (AOR: 8.3; 95% CI: 1.8, 38.6; P = 0.01) than women without the deletion allele and with a folate intake >/=400 microg/day. CONCLUSIONS:The DHFR 19 base pair deletion allele may be a risk factor for preterm delivery. In the presence of low dietary folate, the allele may also be a risk factor for low birth weight. This may be a gene-environment interaction.\n",
      "Mutations in the steroid 5alpha-reductase type 2 (SRD5A2) gene in 46,XY subjects cause masculinization defects to varying degrees, due to reduced or impaired enzymatic activity. In this study, sequence abnormalities of the SRD5A2 gene were assessed by polymerase chain reaction with specific primers and automated sequencing analysis of DNA samples from 20 patients suspected of steroid 5alpha-reductase deficiency. type 2 from 18 Brazilian families. Eleven subjects had homozygous single base SRD5A2 mutations (two first cousins ​​and four unrelated patients with G183S, two with R246W, one with del642T, one with G196S and one with 217_218insC plus the A49T variant in heterozygosity), while four were compound heterozygotes (one with Q126R/IVS3+1G>A, one with Q126R/del418T, and two brothers with Q126R/G158R). Three patients were heterozygous for the A207D, G196S, and R266W substitutions. The V89L polymorphism was found in heterozygosity in one of them (with A207D) and in one case with an otherwise normal genetic sequence. The A49T variant was also detected in heterozygosity in the second case without other sequencing abnormalities. Four patients have previously undescribed mutations in the SRD5A2 gene: a single nucleotide deletion (del642T), a G158R amino acid substitution, a splice junction mutation (IVS3+1G>A), and the insertion of 'a cytosine (217_218insC) occurring at a CCCC. pattern. This is the first report of a single nucleotide insertion in the coding sequence of the SRD5A2 gene. In addition to these novel mutations, this investigation reveals the prevalence of the G183S substitution among a subset of Afro-Brazilian patients and presents evidence for the recurrence of previously known mutations.\n",
      "In this work, we studied the proband in a small nuclear family of Chinese and Dutch/German origin and identified two novel mutations in the type VII collagen gene leading to recessive dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa, Hallopeau-Siemens variant (HS- RDEB). The maternal mutation is a single base pair deletion of a cytosine nucleotide in exon 26, designated 3472delC, resulting in a frameshift and premature termination codon (PTC) in the same exon, 7 bp downstream of the site of the mutation. The paternal mutation is a G-->A transition located at the 5' donor splice site in intron 51, designated IVS51 + 1G-->A. This mutation leads to activation of a cryptic splice site, 32 bp downstream of the mutation site and subsequent aberrant out-of-frame splicing, resulting in two alternative mRNA transcripts and a downstream PTC. To our knowledge, these two mutations have not been reported previously. These findings expand the body of evidence for compound heterozygous mutations leading to HS-RDEB and provide the basis for prenatal diagnosis in this family.\n",
      "OBJECTIVE: To describe the unmasking of pheochromocytoma in a patient treated with amisulpride and tiapride. CASE SUMMARY: A 42-year-old white man developed acute hypertension accompanied by severe headache and vomiting 2 hours after the first doses of amisulpride 100 mg and tiapride 100 mg. Both medications were immediately discontinued and the patient recovered after further treatment with nicardipine and verapamil. Abdominal ultrasound showed an adrenal mass and postoperative histological examination confirmed the diagnosis of pheochromocytoma. DISCUSSION: Symptoms of drug-induced pheochromocytoma are often associated with the use of substituted benzamide medications, but the underlying mechanism is unknown. In our case, the use of the Naranjo probability scale indicated a possible relationship between hypertensive crisis and treatment with amisulpride and tiapride. CONCLUSIONS: As of March 24, 2005, this is the first reported case of hypertensive crisis induced by amisulpride and tiapride in a patient with pheochromocytoma. Physicians and other healthcare professionals should be aware of this potential side effect of tiapride and amisulpride.\n",
      "OBJECTIVE: In the present study, we sought to substantiate the putative importance of angiotensin I converting enzyme (ACE) on gastric cancer biology by investigating the influence of its genetic polymorphism on cancer progression gastric. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Genomic DNA was purified from peripheral blood mononuclear cells or tissue samples. The amplified fragments of the ACE gene were separated on agarose gels. D or I alleles were identified by the presence of fragments of 190 or 490 bp, respectively. Local expression of ACE was studied by immunohistochemistry. RESULTS: Twenty-four of 113 (21%) gastric cancer patients had genotype II, 57 (51%) had genotype ID, and 32 (28%) had genotype DD. The distribution of ACE genotypes did not differ significantly from that of the control group of 189 patients without gastric cancer. However, ACE genotypes were correlated with the number of lymph node metastases and Union Internationale Contra Cancrum (UICC) tumor stage. Patients with genotype II had a significantly lower number of lymph node metastases (P < 0.001) and a significantly lower UICC tumor stage (P = 0.01) than patients with genotype DD. No correlation was found between tumor type, tumor location, local tumor growth, distant metastasis, and ACE genotype. CEA expression in gastric cancer was studied by immunohistochemistry in 100 of 113 patients. CEA was expressed by endothelial cells in all samples (100%) and by tumor cells in 56 samples (56%). CONCLUSIONS: Our study shows that CEA is locally expressed in gastric cancer and that gene polymorphism influences metastatic behavior.\n",
      "OBJECTIVES: To determine the incidence of major bleeding and stroke in people aged 76 years and older with atrial fibrillation on dose-adjusted warfarin who were recently admitted to hospital. DESIGN:A retrospective observational cohort study. SETTING: A large healthcare network involving four tertiary hospitals. PARTICIPANTS: Two hundred and thirty-five patients aged 76 years and older admitted to a large health network between July 1, 2001 and June 30, 2002 for atrial fibrillation on warfarin were enrolled. MEASUREMENTS: Information regarding major bleeding episodes, stroke, and warfarin use was obtained from patients, their relatives, treating physicians, and medical records. RESULTS: Two hundred and twenty-eight patients (42% men) with a mean age of 81.1 years (range 76-94 years) were included in the analysis. Total follow-up on warfarin was 530 years (mean 28 months). There were 53 major hemorrhages, for an annual rate of 10.0%, including 24 (45.3%) life-threatening and five (9.4%) fatal hemorrhages. The annual rate of stroke after starting warfarin therapy was 2.6%. CONCLUSION: The rate of major bleeding was high in this elderly and frail group, but, excluding deaths, it caused no long-term sequelae and the rate of stroke on warfarin was low, demonstrating the effectiveness of warfarin treatment.\n",
      "BACKGROUND:Vitamin D binding protein (DBP) is the major systemic transporter of 1,25(OH)2D3 and is essential for its cellular endocytosis. There are two known polymorphisms in exon 11 of the DBP gene, resulting in amino acid variants: the GAT -> GAG substitution replaces aspartic acid with glutamic acid in codon 416; and the ACG -> AAG substitution in codon 420 leads to an exchange of threonine for lysine. These DBP variants result in differences in affinity for 1,25(OH)2D3. Correlations between DBP alleles and type 1 diabetes have been described in different populations. Therefore, we investigated the codon 416 polymorphism of the DBP gene for association with autoimmune markers of type 1 diabetes. DESIGN AND METHODS: The present analysis was a case-control study. 110 patients, 68 controls and 115 first-degree relatives were genotyped for the DBP polymorphism in codon 416. DNA typing of the DBP locus was carried out by the PCR restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) method. . RESULTS: Asp/Glu and Glu/Glu frequencies were significantly increased in diabetic subjects with detectable IA-2 antibodies (P < 0.01). In contrast, the DBP Glu-containing genotype was not accompanied by differences in the prevalence of GAD65 antibodies. These results confirm the role of the vitamin D endocrine system in the autoimmune process of type 1 diabetes.\n",
      "A single dose of valproic acid (VPA), a widely used antiepileptic drug, is associated with oxidative stress in rats, as recently demonstrated by elevated levels of 15-F(2t)-isoprostane (15-F(2t) )-IsoP ). To determine whether there was a temporal relationship between VPA-associated oxidative stress and hepatotoxicity, adult male Sprague-Dawley rats were treated ip with VPA (500 mg/kg) or saline at 0.9% (vehicle) once daily for 2, 4, 7, 10 or 14 days. Oxidative stress was assessed by determining plasma and hepatic levels of 15-F(2t)-IsoP, lipid hydroperoxides (LPO), and thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBAR). Plasma and hepatic 15-F(2t)-IsoP were elevated and reached a plateau after the second day of VPA treatment compared to control. Hepatic LPO levels were not elevated until day 7 of treatment (1.8-fold compared to control, p < 0.05). Hepatic and plasma TBARs only increased after 14 days (2 times compared to the control, p < 0.05). Liver toxicity was assessed based on serum alpha-glutathione S-transferase (alpha-GST) levels and by histology. Serum alpha-GST levels were significantly elevated on day 4, consistent with hepatotoxicity, as evidenced by the increasing incidence of liver capsule inflammation, necrosis, and steatosis throughout the 'study. Hepatic levels of VPA beta-oxidation metabolites decreased on day 14, while levels of 4-ene-VPA and (E)-2,4-diene-VPA were not elevated throughout. the study. Overall, these results indicate that VPA treatment results in oxidative stress, measured by 15-F(2t)-IsoP levels, which precedes the onset of necrosis, steatosis, and elevated levels of Serum alpha-GST.\n",
      "BACKGROUND: Acetaminophen (paracetamol--P) and nimesulide (N) are widely used analgesic-antipyretic/anti-inflammatory drugs. The rate of adverse hypersensitivity reactions to these agents is generally low. In contrast, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are commonly implicated in such reactions. Celecoxib (CE) is a new drug with high selectivity and affinity for COX-2 enzyme. OBJECTIVE: We evaluated the safety of EC in a group of patients with a documented history of adverse skin reactions to P and N associated or not with conventional NSAIDs. Methods: We studied 9 patients with hypersensitivity to P and N with or without reactions associated with classic NSAIDs. Diagnosis of P- and N-induced skin reactions was based on in vivo challenge. The placebo was administered blindly at the start of each challenge. After three days, a cumulative dose of 200 mg of EC in refracted doses was administered. After 2-3 days, a single dose of 200 mg was administered. All patients were observed for 6 hours after each challenge and checked again after 24 hours to exclude delayed reactions. The test was considered positive if one or more of the following symptoms appeared: erythema, rush, or urticaria-angioedema. RESULTS: No reactions were observed with placebo and eight patients (88.8%) tolerated EC. Only one patient developed moderate angioedema of the lips. CONCLUSION: A single hypersensitivity reaction to EC was documented among 9 patients highly intolerant to NSAIDs P and N. Thus, we conclude that EC is a reasonably safe alternative for use in subjects who do not tolerate P and N .\n",
      "BACKGROUND: T cell immunoglobulin mucin (TIM) proteins and their genetic variants have been suggested to play a role in the regulation of allergic diseases. OBJECTIVE:The genetic association of TIM-1 and TIM-3 gene sequence variants with asthma in an African-American population was investigated. METHODS: Case-control and familial association analyzes were performed for a total of 7 polymorphisms, including 3 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and 1 insertion/deletion polymorphism in TIM-1 and 3 SNPs in TIM- genes. 3. Exposure to hepatitis A virus, as judged by seropositivity, was also examined. RESULTS: In the case-control design, the frequencies of the TT genotype for the SNP rs2277025 and the homozygous deletion variant (157delMTTTVP) in the fourth exon of the TIM-1 gene were higher in asthma patients than in controls (odds ratio [OR], 2.779, P = 0.016 and OR, 3.09, P = 0.022, respectively). This association was supported by haplotype analysis of these SNPs and 2 additional SNPs (OR, 2.48; P = 0.004), as well as by family testing for the allele and haplotype carrying 157delMTTTVP (P = 0.009 and P = 0.048, respectively). Furthermore, this association seems to exist even in subjects seronegative for the hepatitis A virus in our data. None of the three TIM-3 gene variants revealed a significant association with asthma or asthma-related phenotypes. CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that genetic variants in the TIM-1 gene but not in the TIM-3 gene contribute to asthma susceptibility in this African-American population.\n",
      "Stiffness of the masseter muscles during general anesthesia is considered a warning sign of a possible episode of malignant hyperthermia. The decision to continue or interrupt the procedure depends on the urgency of the surgical procedure and the severity of the stiffness of the masseter muscle. Here we describe a case of severe stiffness of the masseter muscle (steel jaw) after administration of succinylcholine (Sch) during general anesthesia for rigid bronchoscopic removal of a tracheal foreign body. Anesthesia continued uneventfully with propofol infusion while all facilities were available to detect and treat malignant hyperthermia.\n",
      "OBJECTIVE:The anthracyclines daunorubicin and doxorubicin as well as the epipodophyllotoxin etoposide are potent DNA cleavage-enhancing drugs that are widely used in clinical oncology; however, myelosuppression and cardiac toxicity limit their use. Dexrazoxane (ICRF-187) is recommended for protection against anthracycline-induced cardiotoxicity. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Due to their widespread use, hematologic toxicity following concomitant administration of dexrazoxane and these three structurally different DNA cleavage enhancers was investigated: The sensitivity of human and murine blood progenitor cells to Etoposide, daunorubicin and doxorubicin +/- dexrazoxane were determined in granulocytes. -macrophage colony formation assays. Similarly, in vivo, B6D2F1 mice were treated with etoposide, daunorubicin and doxorubicin, with or without dexrazoxane over a wide dose range: after treatment, a complete hematological assessment was performed. RESULTS: Nontoxic doses of dexrazoxane reduced myelosuppression and weight loss caused by daunorubicin and etoposide in mice and antagonized their antiproliferative effects in the colony assay; however, dexrazoxane did not reduce myelosuppression, weight loss, or the in vitro cytotoxicity of doxorubicin. CONCLUSION: Although our results support the observation that dexrazoxane does not reduce either the hematologic or antitumor activity of doxorubicin clinically, the potent antagonism of daunorubicin activity raises concerns; possible interference with anticancer efficacy would certainly require renewed attention. Our data also suggest that a significant increase in etoposide dose may be possible with the use of dexrazoxane. Clinical trials in patients with brain metastases combining dexrazoxane and high doses of etoposide are underway with the aim of improving efficacy without worsening hematological toxicity. If successful, this represents an exciting mechanism for the pharmacological regulation of the side effects of cytotoxic chemotherapy.\n",
      "BACKGROUND: Exonic deletions in MSH2 and MLH1 contribute significantly to the mutation spectrum in HNPCC, and heterozygous exon copy number changes are not detected by conventional mutation screening methods. OBJECTIVES: We aimed to develop methods to screen for copy number changes in all exons of the MLH1 and MSH2 genes using a single multiplex amplifiable probe hybridization (MAPH) assay. METHODS: We developed a probe set consisting of probes from all 19 exons of MLH1 and 16 exons of MSH2, as well as 3 control probes, and applied it to screening for deletions and duplications using fluorescent detection of amplified fragments. RESULTS: We tested 73 DNA samples from controls and 50 from HNPCC patients in whom no point mutations were found, and detected 10 copy number changes among the patient samples. A deletion of approximately 1.4 kb including exon 3 of MSH2 was confirmed by amplification of a junction fragment and found to be the result of unequal recombination between Alu intronic elements. CONCLUSIONS: MAPH can detect exonic copy number changes in MLH1 and MSH2 in the DNA of HNPCC patients. Since searching for an exonic deletion or duplication makes full sequence analysis unnecessary, it may be more cost-effective to prescreen samples by MAPH or MLPA before searching for point mutations.\n",
      "Impaired insulin secretion is a fundamental defect of type 2 diabetes. The aim of this study was to determine whether single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in genes regulating insulin secretion (SLC2A2 [encoding GLUT2] , GCK, TCF1 [encoding HNF-1alpha], HNF4A, GIP and GLP1R) are associated with the conversion. from impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) to type 2 diabetes in participants in the Finnish Diabetes Prevention Study. Except for SLC2A2, other genes were not associated with type 2 diabetes risk. All four SNPs in SLC2A2 predicted conversion to diabetes, and rs5393 (AA genotype) increased type 2 diabetes risk threefold in the entire study population (odds ratio 3.04, 95% CI 1.34-6.88, P = 0.008). The risk of type 2 diabetes in carriers of the AA genotype was increased in the control group (5.56 [1.78-17.39], P = 0.003) but not in the intervention group. We conclude that SLC2A2 SNPs predict conversion to diabetes in obese subjects with IGT.\n",
      "RATIONALE: Nicotine and caffeine are licit psychoactive drugs widely used worldwide. Epidemiological studies have shown that they are generally used concomitantly. Although some studies in laboratory animals indicate clear pharmacological interactions between them, no studies have shown a specific interaction on anxiety responses. OBJECTIVES: The present study examines the effects of nicotine on anxiety induced by caffeine and another anxiogenic drug, pentylenetetrazole, in mice. The elevated plus maze test (EPM) was used to assess the effects of medications on anxiety. METHODS: Adult male Swiss Webster mice (25-32 g) received nicotine (0.05-0.25 mg/kg s.c.) or saline 10 minutes before caffeine injections (70 mg/kg i.p.) or pentylenetetrazole (15 and 30 mg/kg i.p.). . After 15 minutes, mice were assessed for their open and closed arm time and entries on the EPM during a 10-minute session. Locomotor activity was recorded for individual groups using the same treatment protocol with the EPM test. RESULTS: Nicotine (0.05-0.25 mg/kg) itself produced no significant effects in the EPM test, whereas caffeine (70 mg/kg) and pentylenetetrazole (30 mg/kg) produced an anxiogenic effect, apparent with a reduction in opening-arming time and entry. Pretreatment with nicotine (0.25 mg/kg) blocked anxiety induced by caffeine, but not by pentylenetetrazole. Administration of each drug and their combinations produced no effect on locomotor activity. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that the antagonistic effect of nicotine on caffeine-induced anxiety is specific to caffeine, instead of a nonspecific anxiolytic effect. Thus, this could extend current findings on the interaction between nicotine and caffeine.\n",
      "A 38-year-old woman was admitted for superior mesenteric vein (SMV) thrombosis, refractory to anticoagulant treatment. Plasma antithrombin activity was diminished and barely compensated by concentrated antithrombin preparation due to the high consumption rate. However, successful anticoagulation was achieved through administration of a direct thrombin inhibitor, argatroban. Family studies of antithrombin activity revealed that she suffered from congenital antithrombin type I deficiency. A novel heterozygous mutation in the antithrombin gene (insertion of a single T nucleotide at 7916 and 7917, Glu 272 stopping in exon 4) was identified. The administration of Argatroban would be effective in the treatment of congenital antithrombin deficiency with SMV thrombosis.\n",
      "Wolfram syndrome (WFS) is an autosomal recessive disorder characterized by early-onset diabetes mellitus, progressive optic atrophy, sensorineural deafness, and diabetes insipidus. Affected individuals may also present with renal tract abnormalities as well as neurological and psychiatric syndromes. WFS1 encoding a transmembrane protein was identified as the gene responsible for WFS. We report here a Japanese family in which two members presented this syndrome. In the WFS1 gene of these patients, we identified a new mutation, an insertion of nine nucleotides (AFF344-345ins). Additionally, one of these patients presented with preclinical hypopituitarism, an unusual feature of WFS. As only the two family members homozygous for the mutation had WFS, these data support the idea that this mutation is the cause of WFS.\n",
      "The SRY gene (sex determining region on the Y chromosome) acts as TDF and is necessary for the regulation of male sex determination. SRY represents a transcription factor belonging to the superfamily of genes sharing the high-mobility group-box (HMG-box) motif, which acts as a DNA-binding region. Deletion and inactivating mutations of SRY are among the known causes of XY sex reversal. Here, we described the screening of 10 patients with 46,XY sex reversal for mutations in the open reading frame (ORF) of the SRY gene. DNA was isolated from blood samples using standard techniques. A 609 bp fragment from the central part of the SRY gene was amplified using primers XES-2 and XES-7. The amplified PCR fragments were cloned into pUCm-T vectors and direct sequencing was performed on an ABI 377-3 automated DNA sequencer to detect the mutation. PCR restriction enzyme digestion was applied to detect the DNA sequencing results. In two patients, de novo mutations led to amino acid substitution. An A was replaced by a G in codon 38 upstream of the 5' boundary outside the HMG box of the SRY gene, resulting in the replacement of the amino acid glutamate with glycine. Another heterozygous T to A transition at nucleotide position +387 which codes for a tyrosine (Tyr) instead of a term, while his father was proven to have the wild-type sequence. These point mutations were confirmed by the restriction enzyme PCR method. As demonstrated by analysis of the Human Gene Mutation Database, homology search, and literature review, these two mutations have not been previously described and carried the total number of substitutions of nucleotides of the SRY (missense/nonsense) gene at 45. These results indicated that these amino acid substitutions may be responsible for sex inversion, not only within the HMG box but also outside the HMG box. The two novel mutations in the SRY gene provided valuable information to understand the molecular mechanism of the 46,XY female sex inversion patient.\n",
      "As a primary target of opioid drugs and peptides, the mu opioid receptor (OPRM1) plays a key role in pain perception and addiction. Genetic variants of OPRM1 have been implicated in drug predisposition, particularly the A118G single nucleotide polymorphism, leading to an N40D substitution, with an allele frequency of 10–32% and uncertain functions. We measured allele-specific OPRM1 mRNA expression in human autopsy brain tissues, using A118G as a marker. In 8 heterozygous samples measured, the A118 mRNA allele was 1.5 to 2.5 times more abundant than the G118 allele. Transfection into Chinese hamster ovary cells of a cDNA representing only the coding region of OPRM1, carrying adenosine, guanosine, cytidine, and thymidine at position 118, resulted in 1.5-fold mRNA levels lower only for OPRM1-G118, and more than 10 times. lower levels of OPRM1 protein, measured by Western blot and receptor binding assay. After transfection and inhibition of transcription with actinomycin D, analysis of mRNA turnover did not reveal differences in mRNA stability between A118 and G118 alleles, indicating a defect in transcription or processing. of mRNA. These results indicate that OPRM1-G118 is a functional variant with deleterious effects on mRNA and protein yield. Clarifying the functional relevance of polymorphisms associated with susceptibility to a complex disorder such as drug addiction provides a basis for clinical association studies.\n",
      "Phosphatidylethanolamine N-methyltransferase (PEMT) catalyzes the synthesis of phosphatidylcholine. PEMT knockout mice have fatty livers, and it is possible that in humans, nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is associated with PEMT gene polymorphisms. DNA samples from 59 humans without fatty liver and 28 humans with NAFLD were genotyped for a single nucleotide polymorphism in exon 8 of PEMT, leading to a V175M substitution. V175M is a loss-of-function mutation, determined by transient transfection of McArdle-RH7777 cells with constructs of the wild-type PEMT open reading frame or the V175M mutant. Met/Met at residue 175 (SNP loss of function) occurred in 67.9% of NAFLD subjects and in only 40.7% of control subjects (P < 0.03). For the first time, we report that a polymorphism in the human PEMT gene (V175M) is associated with decreased activity and may confer susceptibility to NAFLD.\n",
      "The objectives of this study were to examine vancomycin-induced oxidative stress (VCM) which promotes the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and to investigate the role of the expectorant agent erdosteine, which also has antioxidant properties on renal tissue against possible renal failure induced by VCM in rats. Rats were divided into three groups: sham, VCM, and VCM plus erdosteine. VCM was administered intraperitoneally (ip) at 200 mg kg(-1) twice daily for 7 days. Erdosteine ​​was administered orally. Administration of VCM to control rats significantly increased renal excretion of malondialdehyde (MDA) and N-acetyl-beta-d-glucosaminidase (NAG, a marker of renal tubular injury), but decreased the activities superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase (CAT). Administration of erdosteine ​​with VCM injections resulted in a significant decrease in renal excretion of MDA and urinary NAG, as well as an increase in SOD activity, but not CAT activity. in renal tissue compared to VCM alone. Erdosteine ​​showed histopathological protection against VCM-induced nephrotoxicity. There was significant dilation of tubular lumens, extensive vacuolation of epithelial cells, atrophy, desquamation, and necrosis in VCM-treated rats more than in rats in the control and erdosteine ​​groups. Erdosteine ​​caused a marked reduction in the extent of tubular damage. It is concluded that oxidative tubular injury plays an important role in VCM-induced nephrotoxicity and that modulation of oxidative stress with erdosteine ​​reduces VCM-induced renal injury both biochemically and histologically.\n",
      "The mechanisms and neural circuits involved in levodopa-induced dyskinesia are unclear. Using repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) over the supplementary motor area (SMA) in a group of patients with advanced Parkinson's disease, the authors investigated whether modulating SMA excitability could lead to modification of a dyskinetic state induced by continuous infusion of apomorphine. It was observed that 1 Hz rTMS markedly reduced drug-induced dyskinesias, whereas 5 Hz rTMS induced a slight but not significant increase.\n",
      "The PERIOD2 (PER2) gene is a key component of the molecular mechanism that generates circadian rhythms in mammals. A missense mutation in the human PER2 gene has previously been associated with advanced sleep phase syndrome (ASPS). We studied three other single nucleotide polymorphisms in the hPER2 gene, one downstream of the transcription start site (C-1228T), one in exon 2 in the 5' untranslated region (5'-UTR) ( C111G) and a missense mutation (G3853A) causing a substitution of glycine for glutamine in the predicted protein. Subjects selected from a group of 484 volunteers for extreme morning or evening preference, or intermediate daytime preference were genotyped with respect to the three polymorphisms (n = 35 for each group). While allele frequencies for the other two polymorphisms did not differ significantly between groups, the frequency of the 111G allele was significantly higher in subjects with an extreme morning preference (0.14) than in subjects having an extreme preference for the evening (0.03) (Fisher's exact test, two-sided P value = 0.031, odds ratio = 5.67). No significant differences in the frequency of the 111G allele were observed between either of these groups and subjects with an intermediate diurnal preference. Computational prediction indicated that the C111G polymorphism, which occurs 12 bases upstream of the translation initiation codon, could alter the secondary structure of the transcript. The PER2 111G allele associates with morning preference and is a potential candidate allele for ASPS.\n",
      "Nijmegen breakage syndrome (NBS) is an autosomal recessive human disease characterized by genomic instability and increased predisposition to cancer, particularly lymphoma and leukemia. Recently, significantly higher frequencies of heterozygous carriers of the Slavic NBS1 founder mutation, 657del5, were found in Russian children with sporadic lymphoid malignancies and in Polish adults with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL). Additionally, the 643C>T substitution (R215W) was also found in excess in children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). With the aim of evaluating the contribution of both mutations to the development of sporadic lymphoid malignancies, we analyzed DNA samples from a large group of Polish pediatric patients. The NBS1 657del5 mutation on one allele was found in 3 of 270 ALL patients and 2 of 212 children and adolescents with NHL; no carriers were found among 63 patients with Hodgkin lymphoma (HL). No carriers of the R215W variant were detected in any of the groups studied. The relative frequency of the 657del5 mutation was calculated from a total of 6,984 controls matched by patient residence, of which 42 were found to be carriers (frequency = 0.006). In the analyzed population with malignant tumors, an increased odds ratio for the occurrence of the 657del5 mutation was observed compared to the Polish control population (OR range 1.48-1.85, 95% confidence interval 1.18-2.65). This finding indicates that the frequency of mutation carriers was indeed increased in ALL and NHL patients (p < 0.05). However, heterozygosity of the NBS1 gene is not a major risk factor for malignant lymphoid tumors in children and adolescents.\n",
      "Most women with seasonal affective disorder (SAD) experience atypical vegetative symptoms such as overeating and weight gain when depressed. The serotonin 2C receptor (5-HT(2C)) plays a key role in controlling appetite and satiety. A 5-HT(2C) Cys 23 Ser substitution, encoded by a single nucleotide polymorphism (Cys 23 Ser) in the 5-HT(2C) gene, has been shown to influence 5-HT(2C) function. We hypothesized that Cys 23 Ser influences weight regulation in women with SAD. Two independent samples from Austria (162 women with SAD, 119 controls) and Canada (90 women with SAD, 42 controls) were genotyped for Cys 23 Ser. The influence on weight regulation was analyzed in patients with atypical characteristics. In Austrians, the distribution of genotypes differed between patients and controls (p = 0.044) and Cys 23 Ser was associated with weight (p = 0.039), body mass index (BMI; p = 0.038) and seasonal change in appetite (p = 0.031). All values ​​were highest in Cys/Cys carriers, intermediate in Cys/Ser carriers, and lowest in Ser/Ser carriers. In Canadian patients, Cys 23 Ser was associated with lowest lifetime BMI (p = 0.046), with lowest values ​​in Ser/Ser carriers. Our data provide evidence that Cys 23 Ser mediates the severity of weight regulation disorders in women with SAD, and dose-effect differences suggest a direct functional role for Cys 23 Ser in behavioral weight regulation. bodily.\n",
      "Recent reports have demonstrated that mutations in the OPHN1 gene are responsible for syndromic rather than nonspecific mental retardation. Posterior fossa abnormalities with cerebellar hypoplasia have been demonstrated in all male patients reported to date. Here we report a new family with X-linked mental retardation due to a mutation in OPHN1 and present unpublished data on two previously reported families, regarding the facial and psychological phenotype of affected male and female carriers. Our study confirms that cerebellar hypoplasia is a characteristic of this syndrome. Additionally, affected males have facial similarities that may aid diagnosis. Most female carriers have mild mental retardation and subtle facial changes.\n",
      "BACKGROUND: Markers of fibrinolysis, thrombin-activated fibrinolysis inhibitor (TAFI), tissue plasminogen activator (tPA), and plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) ) were studied for the evaluation of the short-term effects of raloxifene administration in postmenopausal women. METHODS: Thirty-nine postmenopausal women suffering from osteopenia or osteoporosis were included in this prospective, controlled clinical study. Twenty-five women received raloxifene hydrochloride (60 mg/day) plus calcium (500 mg/day). Age-matched controls (n = 14) received calcium only. Plasma levels of TAFI, tPA, and PAI-1 antigen were measured at baseline and after 3 months of treatment using commercially available ELISA kits. Individual variations were assessed by the Wilcoxon test. The relationship between these markers and demographic characteristics was studied. RESULTS: Three months of raloxifene treatment was associated with a significant decrease in plasma TAFI antigen concentrations (16% change, P < 0.01) and a significant increase in tPA antigen concentrations (25% change , P < 0.05). A significant correlation was found between baseline TAFI antigen concentrations and duration of amenorrhea (P < 0.05; r = 0.33). CONCLUSION: We suggest that the increased risk of venous thromboembolism due to raloxifene treatment may be related to increased tPA levels, but not to TAFI levels.\n",
      "Alpers syndrome is an autosomal recessive mitochondrial DNA depletion disorder that affects children and young adults. It is characterized by a progressive and fatal disease of the brain and liver. This syndrome has been associated with mutations in POLG, the gene encoding mitochondrial DNA polymerase (pol gamma). Most patients with Alpers syndrome were found to be compound heterozygotes, carrying two pathogenic mutations in trans at the POLG locus. POLG is a nuclear-encoded gene whose protein product is imported into mitochondria, where it is essential for mtDNA replication and repair. We studied skin fibroblasts from a patient with Alpers syndrome with the E873stop/A467T genotype. The E873stop mutation produces a premature termination codon (TAG) in exon 17. The A467T mutation produces a threonine to alanine substitution at a highly conserved site in exon 7. The allele carrying the stop codon (E873-TAG) should produce a truncated stop codon. , catalytically inactive polymerase. However, only the full-length pol gamma protein was detected by Western blot analysis. Here we show that transcripts containing this stop codon undergo nonsense-associated alternative splicing and nonsense-mediated decay. More than 95% of functional POLG mRNA came from the allele carrying the A467T mutation and less than 5% contained the E873stop mutation. These events ensured that virtually all of the POLG protein in the cell was expressed from the A467T allele. Therefore, the Alpers phenotype in this patient was a consequence of single-copy gene dose of the A467T allele and selective elimination of transcripts carrying the E873stop mutation.\n",
      "PURPOSE: Mutations in the CYP4V2 gene, a novel member of the cytochrome P450 gene family on chromosome 4q35, were recently identified in patients with Bietti crystal dystrophy (BCD). The aim of this study was to investigate the spectrum of mutations in this gene in BCD patients from Singapore and to characterize their phenotype. METHODS:Nine patients with BCD from six families were recruited into the study. The 11 exons of the CYP4V2 gene were amplified from patients' genomic DNA by polymerase chain reaction and then sequenced. Detailed characterization of the patients' phenotype was performed by fundal photography, visual field testing, fundal fluorescein angiography, and electroretinography (ERG). RESULTS: Three pathogenic mutations were identified; two mutations, S482X and K386T, were novel and found in three patients. The third mutation, a previously identified 15 bp deletion including the 3' splice site of exon 7, was found in all nine patients, with six patients carrying the deletion in the homozygous state. Haplotype analysis in patients and controls indicated a founder effect for this deletion mutation in exon 7. Clinical heterogeneity was present among patients. Compound heterozygotes for the deletion in exon 7 appeared to have more severe disease than patients homozygous for the deletion. There was a good correlation between clinical stage of disease and ERG changes, but age was not correlated with disease severity. CONCLUSIONS: This study identified novel mutations in the CYP4V2 gene as the cause of BCD. A high carrier frequency for the 15 bp deletion in exon 7 may exist in the Singapore population. Phenotype characterization showed clinical heterogeneity and age was not correlated with disease severity.\n",
      "Migraine is a common, debilitating primary headache disorder with significant mental, physical, and social health implications. The brain neurotransmitter 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT; serotonin) is involved in nociceptive pathways and has been implicated in the pathophysiology of migraine. With few genetic studies investigating the biosynthetic and metabolic enzymes governing 5-HT activity levels and their relationship to migraine, the objective of this study was to evaluate genetic variants within tryptophan hydroxylase human (TPH), amino acid decarboxylase (AADC) and monoamine oxidase A (MAOA) genes in migraine susceptibility. This objective was undertaken using a high-throughput DNA clustering experimental design, which has been shown to be a highly accurate, sensitive and specific method of estimating allele frequencies for single nucleotide polymorphism single, insertion deletion and variable number tandem repeat loci. Applying DNA clustering to a broad range of genetic loci provides greater scope in evaluating population-based genetic association study designs. Despite the application of this high-throughput genotyping method, negative results from the two-step DNA clustering design used to screen loci within the TPH, AADC, and MAOA genes did not confirm their role in susceptibility to migraine.\n",
      "Tics can be effectively treated with atypical antipsychotics such as risperidone, olanzapine, and ziprasidone. However, there are two case reports showing tic-like symptoms, including motor and phonic variants, occurring during treatment with quetiapine or clozapine. We present a 15-year-old girl with schizophrenia who developed frequent involuntary blinking movements after 5 months of treatment with amisulpride (1000 mg daily). The tic-like symptoms completely disappeared after we reduced the amisulpride dose to 800 mg per day. However, his psychosis recurred after dose reduction. We then gave him an additional 100 mg of quetiapine daily. She has been in complete remission on combination therapy for over a year and maintains reasonable function. No tic-like symptoms or other side effects have been reported. In addition to previously reported cases, our patient suggests that tic-like symptoms could occur in some vulnerable individuals during treatment with atypical antipsychotics such as quetiapine, clozapine or amisulpride.\n",
      "The cell's response to DNA damage and its ability to maintain genomic stability through DNA repair are crucial for preventing cancer initiation and progression. Therefore, polymorphism of DNA repair genes may affect the process of carcinogenesis. The importance of genetic variability in mismatch repair (MMR) gene components is well documented in colorectal cancer, but little is known about its role in breast cancer. hMSH2 is one of the crucial MMR proteins. We carried out a case-control study to test the association between two polymorphisms of the hMSH2 gene: an A --> G transition at position 127 producing an Asn --> Ser substitution at codon 127 (the Asn127Ser polymorphism) and a G - - > A transition at position 1032 leading to a Gly --> Asp change at codon 322 (the Gly322Asp polymorphism) and breast cancer risk and cancer progression. Genotypes were determined in peripheral blood lymphocyte DNA from 150 breast cancer patients and 150 age-matched women (controls) by restriction fragment length polymorphism and allele-specific PCR. We observed no correlation between the studied polymorphisms and breast cancer progression assessed by lymph node metastases, tumor size and Bloom-Richardson classification. A strong association between the occurrence of breast cancer and the Gly/Gly phenotype of the Gly322Asp polymorphism (odds ratio 8.39; 95% confidence interval 1.44-48.8) was found. Therefore, MMR might play a role in breast carcinogenesis and the Gly322Asp polymorphism of hMSH2 gene might be considered as a potential marker of breast cancer.\n",
      "Mutations in the p62/Sequestosome 1 (p62/SQSTM1) gene are responsible for both sporadic and familial forms of Paget's disease of bone (PDB). We initially described a methionine -> valine substitution at codon 404 (M404V) of exon 8, in the ubiquitin protein binding domain of the p62/SQSTM1 gene in an Italian PDB patient. Collection of data from the patient's pedigree provided evidence of a familial form of PDB. Extension of genetic analysis to other relatives of this family demonstrated segregation of the M404V mutation with the polyostotic PDB phenotype and allowed the identification of six asymptomatic gene carriers. DNA for mutational analysis of the exon 8 coding sequence was obtained from 22 subjects, 4 PDB patients and 18 clinically unaffected limbs. Of the five clinically affected family members, four had the M404V mutation and had the polyostotic form of PDB, with the exception of one patient with a single skeletal location evaluated by X-ray and one patient with polyostotic disease, who died. several years before the onset of the disease. DNA analysis. By reconstruction and mutational pedigree analysis, six unaffected subjects were found to carry the M404V mutation, representing potential asymptomatic gene carriers whose circulating alkaline phosphatase levels were recently assessed to still be within the normal range. Taken together, these results support a genotype-phenotype correlation between the M404V mutation in the p62/SQSTM1 gene and a polyostotic form of PDB in this family. The high penetrance of the PDB trait in this family as well as the study of asymptomatic gene carriers will allow us to confirm the proposed genotype-phenotype correlation and evaluate the potential use of mutational analysis of the p62/SQSTM1 gene in the detection early onset of loved ones at risk of PDB.\n",
      "OBJECTIVE:Congenital microcoria is a rare autosomal dominant developmental disorder of the iris associated with myopia and juvenile open-angle glaucoma. A link with the chromosomal locus 13q31-q32 has already been reported in a large French family. In the present study, a three-generation Asian Indian family with 15 members affected by congenital microcoria (pupils with diameter <2 mm) was investigated for linkage with candidate microsatellite markers at the 13q31-q32 locus. METHODS: Twenty-four family members were examined clinically and genomic DNA was extracted. Microsatellite markers at 13q31-q32 were amplified by PCR and run on an ABI Prism 310 genetic analyzer and genotyped with GeneScan analysis. Two-point and multipoint linkage analyzes were performed using the programs MLINK and SUPERLINK. RESULTS:The maximum two-point LOD scores of 3.5, 4.7, and 5.3 were found to coincide with consecutive markers D13S154, DCT, and D13S1280. Multipoint analysis revealed a 4 cM region encompassing D13S1300 to D13S1280 where the LOD remains slightly above 6.0. We thus confirm the location of the congenital microcoria locus at chromosomal locus 13q31-q32. Additionally, eight people with both microcoria and glaucoma were screened for the glaucoma genes: myocilin (MYOC), optineurin (OPTN), and CYP1B1. Using direct sequencing, a point mutation (144 G > A) resulting in a Q48H substitution in exon 1 of the MYOC gene was observed in five of eight glaucoma patients, but not in unaffected family members nor in 100 unrelated controls. CONCLUSIONS: We confirmed the localization of the congenital microcoria locus (MCOR) at 13q31-q32 in a large Indian family of Asian origin and conclude that current information suggests that it is a single locus disorder and genetically homogeneous. When combined with the initial linkage paper, our haplotype and linkage data map the MCOR locus to a 6-7 cM region between D13S265 and D13S1280. The DCT locus, a member of the tyrosinases family involved in pigmentation, is mapped in this region. The data presented here support the hypothesis that congenital microcoria is a potential risk factor for glaucoma, although this observation is complicated by partial segregation of MYOC Q48H (1q24.3-q25.2), a mutation known to be associated with glaucoma in India. Fine mapping and analysis of candidate genes continues in the hope that characterization of the microcoria gene will lead to a better understanding of the causes of microcoria and glaucoma. The relationship between microcoria, glaucoma and MYOC Q48H mutation in this family is discussed.\n",
      "PURPOSE: Nitric oxide has many beneficial functions in the human body in appropriate amounts, but it can also be harmful if produced in quantities greater than necessary and has therefore been studied in relation to several neurological and non-neurological disorders . In vitro and in vivo studies demonstrate a link between the inducible form of nitric oxide synthase, iNOS, and the neuropathological disorder glaucoma, one of the leading causes of blindness worldwide. In this study, we aimed to establish the genetic association between iNOS and primary open-angle glaucoma, POAG, and to find the functional element(s) related to the pathogenesis of the disease. METHODS: Two microsatellites, 1 insertion/deletion and 8 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the iNOS regulatory region were genotyped in 200 POAG patients and 200 age-matched controls. Additionally, the CCTTT microsatellite was examined for its protein binding capacity in an electrophoretic mobility shift assay, EMSA. RESULTS: There was a significant difference in the distribution of CCTTT microsatellite alleles between patients and controls. (CCTTT)14, which would have higher activity in a reporter construct, was significantly more abundant in POAG patients, while (CCTTT)10 and (CCTTT)13 were less common. In EMSA, the (CCTTT) 14 allele exhibited specific binding to nuclear proteins. CONCLUSIONS: These results, as well as other studies on this gene and the CCTTT microsatellite, establish, for the first time, a genetic association of iNOS with POAG and suggest a regulatory function of the microsatellite.\n",
      "There is now evidence suggesting a central role of the dopamine system in restless legs syndrome (RLS). For example, RLS symptoms may be significantly improved by levodopa and dopamine agonists, while central dopamine D2 receptor antagonists may induce or worsen RLS symptoms. To our knowledge, there are no previous reports indicating whether domperidone, a peripheral dopamine D2 receptor antagonist, can also induce or worsen RLS symptoms. Mirtazapine, the first specific noradrenergic and serotonergic antidepressant (NaSSA), has been associated with RLS in several recent publications. Here, the authors report a comorbid depressed patient with postprandial dyspepsia who developed RLS after mirtazapine was added to his domperidone treatment. Our patient began experiencing RLS symptoms only after being treated with mirtazapine, and his RLS symptoms completely resolved upon discontinuation of his mirtazapine. Such a temporal relationship between mirtazapine use and RLS symptoms in our patient did not support a potentiating effect of domperione on mirtazapine-associated RLS. However, physicians should be aware of the possibility that mirtazapine may be associated with RLS in some individuals, particularly those receiving concomitant dopamine D2 receptor antagonists.\n",
      "The effect of ritanserin (5-HT2 antagonist) on amnesia induced by scopolamine (muscarinic cholinergic antagonist) in the Morris water maze (MWM) was investigated. Rats were divided into eight groups and cannulated bilaterally in the CA1 region of the hippocampus. One week later, they were repeatedly given vehicles (saline, DMSO, saline+DMSO), scopolamine (2 microg/0.5 microl saline/side; 30 min before training), ritanserin (2, 4 and 8 microg/0.5 microl DMSO/side; 20 min before training) and scopolamine (2 microg/0.5 microl; 30 min before injection of ritanserin) + ritanserin (4 microg/0.5 microl DMSO) through cannulae each day. Animals were tested for four consecutive days (4 trials/day) in MWM during which the position of the hidden platform was unchanged. During the fifth day, the platform was raised above the water surface in another position to assess the functioning of the motor, motivational and visual systems. Results showed a significant increase in escape latencies and distances traveled to find a platform in the scopolamine-treated group compared to the saline group. Rats treated with ritanserin (4 microg/0.5 microl/side) showed a significant decrease in the mentioned parameters compared to the DMSO treated group. However, co-administration of scopolamine and ritanserin resulted in a significant decrease in escape latencies and distances traveled compared to scopolamine-treated rats. Our results show that microinjection of ritanserin into the CA1 region of the hippocampus improves scopolamine-induced amnesia.\n",
      "Cardiotoxicity is a rare complication occurring during the treatment of malignancies with 5-fluorouracil (5-FU). Here we report the case of a 70-year-old man with 5-FU-induced cardiotoxicity, in whom an elevated serum level of alpha-fluoro-beta-alanine (FBAL) was observed. The patient, who had unresectable metastases of colon cancer to the liver and lungs, was referred to us for chemotherapy from an affiliated hospital; he had no history of heart disease. After admission, the patient received a continuous intravenous infusion of 5-FU (1000 mg/day), during which precordial pain with right bundle branch block occurred concomitantly with an elevated serum FBAL concentration of 1 955 ng/ml. The precordial pain and electrocardiographic changes resolved spontaneously after discontinuation of 5-FU. As precordial pain in this patient was considered to be due to 5-FU-induced cardiotoxicity, 5-FU administration was discontinued. Instead, oral administration of S-1 (a 5-FU derivative), 200 mg/day twice a week, was instituted, because S-1 has a strong inhibitory effect on dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase, which catalyzes the degradation of 5-FU. in FBAL. The serum concentration of FBAL then decreased to 352 ng/ml, the same as the value measured on the first day of S-1 administration. Thereafter, no cardiac symptoms were observed. The patient achieved a partial response 6 months after starting S-1 treatment. The experience of this case, as well as a review of the literature, suggests that FBAL is linked to 5-FU-induced cardiotoxicity. S-1 can be safely administered to patients with 5-FU-induced cardiotoxicity.\n",
      "A homozygous deletion of the DOCK8 (cytokinesis dedicator 8) locus at chromosome 9p24 was found in a lung cancer cell line by array-CGH analysis. Cloning of the complete DOCK8 cDNA led us to define that the DOCK8 gene encodes a protein consisting of 2,099 amino acids. DOCK8 was expressed in various human organs, including the lungs, and was also expressed in alveolar, bronchiolar, and type II bronchial epithelial cells, which are considered progenitors of lung cancer cells. DOCK8 expression was reduced in 62/71 (87%) primary lung cancers compared to normal lung tissue, and the reduction occurred regardless of the histological type of lung cancer. 5-Aza-2'-deoxy-cytidine and/or Trichostatin A treatments induced DOCK8 expression in lung cancer cell lines with reduced DOCK8 expression. Therefore, epigenetic mechanisms, including DNA methylation and histone deacetylation, were indicated to be involved in the downregulation of DOCK8 in lung cancer cells. Further screening revealed homozygous deletions of the DOCK8 gene in a gastric and breast cancer cell line. DOCK family proteins have been shown to play a role in regulating cell migration, morphology, adhesion, and growth. Thus, the present results suggest that genetic and epigenetic inactivation of DOCK8 is involved in the development and/or progression of lung cancer and other cancers by disrupting these regulations.\n",
      "Current knowledge of genetic alterations in glioblastomas is largely based on genetic analyzes of tumors originating primarily from Caucasian patients in the United States and Europe. In the present study, screening for several key genetic alterations was performed on 77 primary (de novo) glioblastomas in Japanese patients. SSCP followed by DNA sequencing revealed TP53 mutations in 16 of 73 (22%) glioblastomas and PTEN mutations in 13 of 63 (21%) cases analyzed. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) showed EGFR amplification in 25 of 77 cases (32%) and homozygous p16 deletion in 32 of 77 cases (42%). Quantitative microsatellite analysis revealed 10q LOH in 41 of 59 (69%) glioblastomas. The frequencies of these genetic alterations were similar to those reported for primary glioblastomas in the Swiss population. As previously observed for glioblastomas in Europe, there was a positive association between EGFR amplification and p16 deletion (p = 0.009), whereas there was an inverse association between TP53 mutations and deletion of p16. p16 (p = 0.049) in glioblastomas in Japan. Multivariate analyzes showed that radiotherapy was significantly predictive of longer survival of patients with glioblastoma (p = 0.002). SSCP followed by DNA sequencing of the kinase domain (exons 18-21) of the EGFR gene revealed mutations in 2 of 69 (3%) glioblastomas in Japan and in 4 of 81 (5%) glioblastomas in Switzerland. The allele frequencies of polymorphisms at codon 787 CAG/CAA (Gln/Gln) in glioblastomas in Japan were G/G (82.4%), G/A (10.8%), A/A (6.8%) ), corresponding to G 0.878 versus A 0.122, significantly different from those of glioblastomas in Switzerland: G/G (27.2%), G/A (28.4%), A/A (44.4%), corresponding at G 0.414 versus A 0.586 (p < 0.0001). These results suggest that primary glioblastomas in Japan have similar genetic alterations to those in Switzerland, suggesting a similar molecular basis in Caucasians and Asians, despite different genetic backgrounds, including different status of an EGFR gene polymorphism.\n",
      "BACKGROUND: Familial partial lipodystrophy (Dunnigan) type 3 (FPLD3, Mendelian Inheritance in Man [MIM] 604367) results from heterozygous mutations in PPARG encoding peroxisomal proliferator-activated receptor gamma. Dominant negative and haploinsufficiency mechanisms have been suggested for this disease. METHODS: We present a Canadian FPLD3 kindred with an affected mother who had loss of arm and leg fat, but no increase in facial, neck, suprascapular, or abdominal fat. She had profound insulin resistance, diabetes, severe hypertriglyceridemia, and recurrent pancreatitis, while her prepubescent daughter had normal fat distribution but elevated plasma triglycerides and C-peptide and cholesterol. with depressed high-density lipoproteins. RESULTS: Mother and daughter were each heterozygous for the nonsense mutation PPARG Y355X, whose in vitro protein product was transcriptionally inactive with no dominant negative activity against the wild-type receptor. Additionally, the mutant protein appeared distinctly unstable. CONCLUSION: Taken together with previous studies of human PPARG mutations, these results suggest that PPAR-gamma deficiency due to either haploinsufficiency or substantial loss of activity due to dominant negative interference of product function normal allele can each contribute to the FPLD3 phenotype.\n",
      "BACKGROUND: Sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) is the most common cause of death in the postperinatal period in Germany. Recently, a lethal phenotype characterized by sudden infant death syndrome with testicular dysgenesis (SIDDT) was identified as being due to loss of function and mutations in the TSPYL1 gene. OBJECTIVE: The aim of the study was to reveal a possible role of TSPYL1 in SIDS. METHODS: DNA samples from 126 SIDS cases and 261 controls were studied. RESULTS: We found five sequence variations, each of which caused an amino acid substitution. No Hardy Weinberg disequilibrium or significant differences in allele frequencies between patients and controls were observed for any variation. In one patient, an amino acid polymorphism p.F366L was found heterozygous, which could not be displayed in controls. A pathogenic implication of this substitution, conserved in primates and rodents, cannot be completely excluded. As SIDDT is the result of homozygous TSPYL1 mutations, this heterozygous exchange cannot alone explain the sudden death of this child. The reported mutation associated with SIDDT (457_458insG) was not detectable in our cohort. CONCLUSION: No association of sequence variations in the TSPYL1 gene and SIDS was found in a German cohort. Genetic analysis of TSPYL1 appears to have limited importance in the differential diagnosis of SIDS without testicular dysgenesis.\n",
      "COX-2 is a key enzyme in the conversion of arachidonic acid to prostaglandins. Prostaglandins produced by COX-2 are involved in inflammation and the pain response in different tissues of the body. Accumulating evidence from epidemiological studies, carcinogenic chemical-induced rodent models, and clinical trials indicates that COX-2 plays a role in human carcinogenesis and is overexpressed in prostate cancer tissues. We examined whether COX-2 gene sequence variants were associated with prostate cancer risk. We analyzed a large population-based case-control study of Prostate Cancer in Sweden (CAPS), including 1378 cases and 782 controls. We evaluated 16 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) covering the entire COX-2 gene in 94 subjects in the control group. Five SNPs had a minor allele frequency of more than 5% in our study population and these were genotyped in all cases, patients and control subjects and gene-specific haplotypes were constructed. A statistically significant difference in allele frequency between cases and controls was observed for 2 of the SNPs (+3,100 T/G and +8,365 C/T), with an odds ratio of 0.78 (CI to 95% = 0.64-0.96) and 0.65 (95% CI = 0.45-0.94) respectively. In the haplotype analysis, 1 haplotype carrying the variant allele of +3100 T/G and +8365 C/T, with a population frequency of 3%, was also significantly associated with decreased risk of prostate cancer (p = 0.036, global simulation). p-value = 0.046). This study supports the hypothesis that inflammation is involved in prostate carcinogenesis and that sequence variation within the COX-2 gene influences prostate cancer risk.\n",
      "Several studies have suggested that regulator of G protein signaling 4 (RGS4) may be a positional and functional candidate gene for schizophrenia. Three single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) located at the promoter region (SNP4 and SNP7) and intron 1 (SNP18) of RGS4 were verified in different ethnic groups. Positive results were reported in these SNPs with different numbers of combinatorial SNP haplotypes. In this study, these three SNP markers were genotyped in 218 schizophrenia pedigrees from Taiwan (864 individuals) for association analysis. Among these three SNPs, neither SNP4, SNP7, SNP18 showed significant association with schizophrenia in single-locus association analysis, nor did any composition of the three SNP haplotypes show significant association with schizophrenia diagnosed by the DSM-IV. Our results fail to support RGS4 as a candidate gene for schizophrenia when assessed from these three SNP markers.\n",
      "A relatively high frequency of germline genomic rearrangements in MLH1 and MSH2 has been reported in Lynch syndrome patients (HNPCC) from different ethnic populations. To investigate the underlying molecular mechanisms, we characterized the DNA breakpoints of 11 germline deletions, six for MLH1 and five for MSH2. Distinct deletion patterns were found for the two genes. The five cases of MSH2 deletions result exclusively from unequal intragenic recombination mediated by repetitive Alu sequences. In contrast, five out of six MLH1 deletions are due to recombinations involving sequences without significant homology (P = 0.015). Detailed analysis of DNA breakpoints in both genes, previously characterized by other groups, validated the observation that Alu-mediated unequal recombination is the major deletion type in MSH2 (n = 34) , but not in MLH1 (n = 21). (P<0.0001). Plotting the distribution of known DNA breakpoints among the introns of both genes showed that the highest breakpoint density is co-localized with the highest Alu density. Our study suggests that Alu is a factor promoting genomic recombinations in MLH1 and MSH2, and that local Alu density might be involved in the formation of the deletion pattern.\n",
      "In recent years, working memory deficits have been reported among MDMA (3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine, ecstasy) users. The present study aimed to assess the impact of MDMA consumption on three distinct central executive processes (set shifting, inhibition, and memory updating) as well as “prefrontal” mediated social and emotional judgment processes. . Fifteen polyecstasy users and 15 control non-ecstasy polyusers completed a general drug use questionnaire, the Brixton Spatial Anticipation task (set shifting), the Backward Digit Span procedure (memory updating), inhibition of return (inhibition), an emotional intelligence scale, the Tromso social intelligence scale and the dysexecutive questionnaire (DEX). Compared to polydrug controls without MDMA, MDMA polyusers showed impairments in set shifting and memory updating, as well as in social and emotional judgment processes. These last two deficits remained significant after controlling for the consumption of other drugs. These data further support the hypothesis that cognitive processes mediated by the prefrontal cortex could be impaired by recreational ecstasy use.\n",
      "Although 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA or ecstasy) has been shown to damage serotonergic (5-HT) neurons in the brain in animals and possibly humans, little is known about the long-term consequences 5-HT neurotoxic lesions induced by MDMA on functions. in which 5-HT is involved, such as cognitive function. Since 5-HT transporters play a key element in regulating 5-HT synaptic transmission, it may be important to control for the potential covariance effect of a polymorphism in the transporter 5 promoter gene region. -HT (5-HTTLPR) when studying the effects. of MDMA as well as cognitive functioning. The aim of the study was to investigate the effects of moderate and heavy MDMA consumption on cognitive function, as well as the effects of long-term MDMA abstention, in subjects genotyped for 5-HTTLPR. A second goal of the study was to determine whether these effects differ for women and men. Fifteen moderate MDMA users (<55 lifetime tablets), 22 heavy MDMA+ users (>55 lifetime tablets), 16 former MDMA+ users (last tablet > 1 year ago) and 13 controls were compared on a battery neuropsychological tests. DNA from peripheral nuclear blood cells was genotyped for 5-HTTLPR using standard polymerase chain reaction methods. A significant group effect was observed only on tasks related to memory function (p = 0.04), but not on reaction times (p = 0.61) or attention/attention functioning. execution. (p = 0.59). Heavy and ex-MDMA+ users performed significantly worse on memory tasks than controls. In contrast, no signs of memory problems were observed in moderate MDMA users. No significant effects of 5-HTTLPR or sex were observed. Although consumption of MDMA in amounts that may be considered \"moderate\" is not associated with impaired memory functioning, excessive consumption of MDMA can lead to lasting memory impairment. No effects of 5-HTTLPR or sex on memory function or MDMA use were observed.\n",
      "OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to analyze the value of germline and tumor thymidylate synthase (TS) genotyping as a prognostic marker in a series of colorectal cancer patients receiving adjuvant fluorouracil-based therapy. (FU). Patients and methods: One hundred and twenty-nine patients with colorectal cancer treated homogeneously with FU plus levamisole or leucovorin as adjuvant treatment were included. The TS enhancer region, 3RG > C single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) and TS 1494del6 polymorphisms were evaluated in fresh-frozen normal mucosa and tumor. Mutational analyzes of TS and allelic imbalances were studied in all primary tumors and in 18 additional metachronic metastases. TS protein immunostaining was evaluated in an expanded series of 214 tumors. Multivariate Cox models were adjusted for stage, differentiation, and location. RESULTS: Tumor genotyping (frequency of allelic loss, 26%) showed that the 3R/3R genotype was associated with a better prognosis (hazard ratio [HR] = 0.38; 95% CI, 0.16 to 0 .93; P = 0.020 for recessive type). model). 3RG > C SNP genotyping did not add prognostic information. The TS 1494del6 tumor allele (frequency of allelic loss, 36%) was protective (for each allele with deletion, based on an additive model, HR = 0.42; 95% CI, 0.22 to 0, 82; P = 0.0034). Both polymorphisms were in strong linkage disequilibrium (D' = 0.71, P < 0.001), and the 3R/-6 base pair (bp) haplotype showed a significant overall survival benefit compared to the most prevalent 2R/+6bp (HR = 0.42; 95% CI, 0.20 to 0.85; No TS point mutations were detected in primary tumors or metastases. Protein immunostaining TS was not associated with survival or with any of the genotypes analyzed. CONCLUSION: The TS 1494del6 tumor genotype may be a prognostic factor in FU-based adjuvant treatment of patients with colorectal cancer.\n",
      "Children with status epilepticus have continuous or rapidly repeating seizures that can be life-threatening and cause permanent changes in the brain and behavior. The extent to which status epilepticus causes auditory discrimination deficits is unknown. A naturalistic method of auditory location discrimination was used to evaluate this question using an animal model of status epilepticus. Male Sprague-Dawley rats were injected with saline on postnatal day (P) 20 or with a convulsive dose of pilocarpine at P20 or P45. Pilocarpine, daily, induced status epilepticus; status epilepticus at P45 resulted in CA3 cell loss and spontaneous seizures, whereas P20 rats showed no cell loss or spontaneous seizures. Mature rats were trained in sound source localization and sound-silence discrimination. Control rats (P20 saline) acquired both discriminations immediately. In rats with status epilepticus (P20), acquisition of sound source location discrimination was moderately impaired. Rats in status epilepticus (P45) failed to acquire sound source localization or sound-silence discrimination. Status epilepticus in rats causes long-term, age-dependent impairment of auditory discrimination. This impairment may explain one of the causes of impaired auditory location discrimination in humans.\n",
      "Cystic fibrosis (CF) was one of the first inherited diseases for which gene therapy was seriously considered as a realistic treatment option and, as such, has long been a paradigm for gene therapy of inherited diseases. However, despite the cloning of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator gene in 1989, more than 15 years later, practical gene therapy for cystic fibrosis has not been achieved. There are a number of reasons for this, and analysis of the specific issues that have delayed the successful development of gene therapy for cystic fibrosis also provides general insight into the practical complexities involved in the development of gene therapy for cystic fibrosis. hereditary. Problems that have prevented the application of gene therapy for cystic fibrosis to date include the lack of appropriate gene delivery technologies, the complexity of host-vector interactions, the biology of the pulmonary airways and the nature of the pathology observed in individuals. with CF. We will discuss the history of gene therapy for cystic fibrosis with specific reference to these and other questions currently preoccupying the field: namely, the question of which vectors appear suitable for gene delivery into pathways respiratory tract in cystic fibrosis, which cells should be targeted, how defenses of the airway epithelium can be overcome or evaded to enable efficient gene transmission, how to ensure safe and long-term transgene expression and need to identify relevant surrogate measures that can be used to evaluate the outcomes of gene therapy in patients with cystic fibrosis.\n",
      "A 74-year-old man with depressive symptoms was admitted to a psychiatric hospital for insomnia, loss of appetite, exhaustion, and agitation. Medical treatment was initiated at a daily dose of 20 mg paroxetine and 1.2 mg alprazolam. On the 10th day of treatment with paroxetine and alprazolam, the patient presented with marked psychomotor delay, disorientation and severe muscle rigidity accompanied by tremors. The patient had fever (38.2 degrees C), fluctuating blood pressure (between 165/90 and 130/70 mg mm Hg), and severe extrapyramidal symptoms. Laboratory tests showed elevated levels of creatine phosphokinase (2,218 IU/L), aspartate aminotransferase (134 IU/L), alanine aminotransferase (78 IU/L), and BUN (27.9 mg /ml). The patient received bromocriptine and diazepam to treat his symptoms. 7 days later, the fever disappeared and the patient's serum CPK levels normalized (175 IU/L). This patient presented with symptoms of neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS), demonstrating that NMS-like symptoms can occur following combined treatment with paroxetine and alprazolam. The adverse drug reaction score obtained by the Naranjo algorithm was 6 in our case, indicating a probable relationship between the patient's NMS-like adverse symptoms and the combination treatment used in this case. The involvement of physiological and environmental aspects specific to this patient was suspected. Several risk factors for NMS should be noted in elderly depressed patients whose symptoms often include dehydration, agitation, malnutrition, and exhaustion. Cautious therapeutic intervention is necessary in cases involving elderly patients with depression.\n",
      "We report an unusual case of an inherited disease of the desmosomal protein plakophilin 1, leading to a syndrome of ectodermal dysplasia and skin fragility. The affected 6-year-old boy had red skin at birth and subsequently developed skin fragility, progressive plantar keratoderma, nail dystrophy, and alopecia. Skin biopsy revealed widening of intercellular spaces in the epidermis and a reduced number of small, poorly formed desmosomes. Mutation analysis of the plakophilin 1 PKP1 gene revealed a homozygous deletion of C at nucleotide 888 in exon 5. This mutation differs from the PKP1 gene pathology reported in 8 previously published individuals with this rare genodermatosis . However, all cases show similar clinical features, highlighting the importance of functional plakophilin 1 in maintaining desmosomal adhesion in the skin, as well as the role of this protein in certain aspects of ectodermal development.\n",
      "BACKGROUND: Drug-induced long QT syndrome is a serious adverse drug reaction. Methadone prolongs the QT interval in vitro in a dose-dependent manner. In the hospital setting, the frequency of QT prolongation with methadone treatment, its dose dependence, and the importance of cofactors such as drug interactions remain unknown. METHODS: We performed a systematic retrospective study comparing active or former IV drug users receiving methadone and those not receiving methadone among all inpatients over a 5-year period at a tertiary care hospital. A total of 167 patients receiving methadone met the inclusion criteria and were compared to a control group of 80 injection drug users not receiving methadone. In addition to methadone dose, 15 demographic, laboratory, and pharmacological variables were considered as potential risk factors for QT prolongation. RESULTS: Among 167 patients undergoing methadone maintenance treatment, the prevalence of QTc interval prolongation to 0.50 seconds ((1/2)) or more was 16.2%, compared with 0. % in 80 control subjects. Six patients (3.6%) in the methadone group presented torsade de pointes. QTc interval length was weakly but significantly associated with daily methadone dose (Spearman's rank correlation coefficient, 0.20; P < 0.01). Multivariate regression analysis attributed 31.8% of QTc variability to methadone dose, cytochrome P-450 3A4 drug interactions, hypokalemia, and impaired liver function. CONCLUSIONS: QT prolongation in methadone maintenance patients hospitalized in a tertiary care center is a common finding. Methadone dose, presence of cytochrome P-450 3A4 inhibitors, potassium levels, and liver function contribute to QT prolongation. Long QT syndrome may occur with low doses of methadone.\n",
      "Loss of endothelial cell-derived nitric oxide (NO) in hypertension is a hallmark of arterial dysfunction. Experimental hypertension created by NO elimination, however, involves mechanisms in addition to a decrease in arterial vasodilator activity. These include increased endothelin-1 (ET-1) release, increased sympathetic nervous system activity, and elevated tissue oxidative stress. We hypothesized that increased venous smooth muscle (venomotor) tone plays a role in Nomega-nitro-L-arginine (LNNA) hypertension through these mechanisms. Rats were treated with the NO synthase inhibitor LNNA (0.5 g/L in drinking water) for 2 weeks. The mean blood pressure of conscious rats was 119 +/- 2 mm Hg in control rats and 194 +/- 5 mm Hg in LNNA rats (P < 0.05). The carotid arteries and vena cava were removed to measure isometric contraction. Peak norepinephrine contraction was slightly reduced in LNNA arteries compared to control rats, while peak ET-1 contraction was significantly reduced (54% control). Maximal vena cava contraction to norepinephrine (37% control) was also reduced, but no change in response to ET-1 was observed. Mean circulatory filling pressure, an in vivo measure of venomotor tone, was not elevated in LNNA hypertension 1 or 2 weeks after LNNA. The superoxide scavenger tempol (30, 100 and 300 micromol kg(-1), IV) did not modify blood pressure in control rats but caused a dose-dependent decrease in LNNA rats (-18 +/- 8, -26 +/- 15 and -54 +/- 11 mm Hg). Similarly, ganglion blockade with hexamethonium caused a significantly greater decline in LNNA hypertensive rats (76 +/- 9 mm Hg) compared to control rats (35 +/- 10 mm Hg). The carotid arteries, vena cava, and sympathetic ganglia of LNNA rats had higher basal superoxide levels than those of control rats. These data suggest that although NO deficiency increases oxidative stress and sympathetic activity in arterial and venous vessels, the impact on veins does not make a major contribution to this form of hypertension.\n",
      "To evaluate the antioxidant effects of atorvastatin (atorva) on dexamethasone (dex)-induced hypertension, 60 male Sprague-Dawley rats were treated with 30 mg/kg/day atorva or tap water. for 15 days. Dex increased systolic blood pressure (SBP) from 109 +/- 1.8 to 135 +/- 0.6 mmHg and plasma superoxide (5711 +/- 284.9 saline, 7931 +/- 392, 8 U/ml dex, P < 0.001). In this prevention study, SBP in the atorva + dex group increased from 115 +/- 0.4 to 124 +/- 1.5 mmHg, but it was significantly lower than that in the dex only group (P' < 0 .05). Atorva reversed dex-induced hypertension (129 +/- 0.6 mmHg, versus 135 +/- 0.6 mmHg P' < 0.05) and decreased plasma superoxide (7931 +/- 392.8 dex, 1187 +/- 441.2 atorva + dex, P < 0.0001). Plasma nitrate/nitrite (NOx) was decreased in dex-treated rats compared to saline-treated rats (11.2 +/- 1.08 microm, 15.3 +/- 1.17 microm, respectively, P < 0.05). Atorva did not affect plasma NOx or thymus weight. Thus, atorvastatin prevented and reversed dexamethasone-induced hypertension in rats.\n",
      "Hepatocyte nuclear factor 4alpha (HNF4alpha) is a transcription factor necessary for normal function of the human liver and pancreatic islets. We investigated whether single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of HNF4A, encoding HNF4alpha, influenced the conversion of impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) to type 2 diabetes mellitus in subjects in the STOP-NIDDM trial. This trial aimed to evaluate the effect of acarbose compared to placebo in the prevention of type 2 diabetes mellitus. Eight SNPs spanning the intragenic and alternative P2 promoter regions of HNF4A were genotyped in study samples at the TaqMan allelic discrimination tests help. Three SNPs in the P2 promoter region (rs4810424, rs1884614 and rs2144908) were in almost complete association (D' > 0.97, r(2) > 0.95) and therefore only rs4810424 was included in further analyzes . Women carrying the less frequent C allele of rs4810424 had a 1.7-fold increased risk [95% confidence interval (CI) 1.09-2.66; P = 0.020] for conversion to diabetes compared with women with the common genotype after adjusting for age, treatment group (placebo or acarbose), smoking, baseline weight, and weight change. No association was found in men. Haplotype analysis based on three SNPs (rs4810424, rs2071197 and rs3818247) representing blocks of linkage disequilibrium in our study population indicated that conversion to type 2 diabetes mellitus depended on the number of risk alleles in different haplotypes in women. Our results suggest that HNF4A SNPs and their haplotypes predispose to type 2 diabetes mellitus in women in the STOP-NIDDM study population.\n",
      "Multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 (MEN1) is characterized by enteropancreatic parathyroid, endocrine, and pituitary adenomas as well as a germline mutation in the MEN1 gene. We describe 2 families with MEN1 with novel mutations in the MEN1 gene. One family was of Turkish origin and the index patient had primary hyperparathyroidism (PHPT) plus prolactinoma; three family members had only PHPT. The index patient from the second family was a 46-year-old woman of Chinese origin living in Taiwan. This patient presented with a complaint of epigastric pain and watery diarrhea for the past 3 months and had undergone a subtotal parathyroidectomy and enucleation of a pancreatic islet cell tumor approximately 10 years previously. There was also a prolactinoma. Analysis of the MEN1 gene sequence from leukocyte genomic DNA revealed heterozygous mutations in both probands. The Turkish patient and her affected relatives all presented a heterozygous A to G transition at codon 557 (AAG-->GAG) of exon 10 of MEN1 which results in a replacement of lysine by glutamic acid. The Chinese index patient and one of her siblings had a heterozygous mutation at codon 418 of exon 9 (GAC -> TAT) which results in a substitution of aspartic acid by tyrosine. In conclusion, we identified 2 new missense mutations in the MEN1 gene.\n",
      "The cell's sensitivity to mutagens and its ability to repair DNA damage are important for the induction, promotion and progression of cancer. Mutagen sensitivity and DNA repair efficiency can be affected by variation in several genes, including DNA repair genes. The hOGG1 gene encodes base excision repair glycosylase and RAD51 specifies a key protein in homologous recombination repair. Both may be involved in the repair of oxidative DNA damage, which can contribute to stomach cancer. In the present work, we determined the level of basal and oxidative DNA damage and the kinetics of elimination of hydrogen peroxide-induced DNA damage in peripheral blood lymphocytes of 30 patients with gastric cancer and 30 healthy individuals. Study measurements of DNA damage and repair were correlated with genotypes of common hOGG1 and RAD51 gene polymorphisms: a G-->C transversion at position 1245 of the hOGG1 gene producing a Ser-- substitution >Cys at codon 326 (the Ser326Cys polymorphism) and a G-->C substitution at position 135 (5' untranslated region) of the RAD51 gene (the G135C polymorphism). DNA damage and repair were assessed by single-cell alkaline gel electrophoresis (comet assay) assisted by DNA repair enzymes: endonuclease III (Nth) and formamidopyrimidine-DNA glycosylase (Fpg). , preferentially recognizing oxidized DNA bases. Polymorphism genotypes were determined by restriction fragment length polymorphism PCR. We observed a strong association between the occurrence of gastric cancer, impaired DNA repair in human lymphocytes and the G/C genotype of the G135C polymorphism of the RAD51 gene. Additionally, there was a strong correlation between this genotype and the occurrence of stomach cancer in subjects with a high level of oxidatively damaged DNA. We observed no correlation between the Ser1245Cys polymorphism of the hOGG1 gene and gastric cancer, including subjects with impaired DNA repair and/or high levels of endogenous oxidative DNA damage. Therefore, our results suggest that the G135C polymorphism of the RAD51 gene could be linked to gastric cancer through modulation of the cellular response to oxidative stress and that this polymorphism could be a useful additional marker in this disease, alongside genetic and/or genetic indicators. or environmental. oxidative stress.\n",
      "BACKGROUND:Hereditary hypophosphatemic rickets with hypercalciuria (HHRH) is a rare metabolic disorder, characterized by hypophosphatemia and rickets/osteomalacia with increased serum 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D [1,25-(OH)(2)D ] leading to hypercalciuria. OBJECTIVE: Our objective was to determine whether mutations in the SLC34A3 gene, which codes for the type IIc sodium-phosphate cotransporter, are responsible for the occurrence of HHHR. DESIGN AND SETUP: Mutation analysis of adjacent exons and introns in the SLC34A3 gene was performed in a university research laboratory and medical center. PATIENTS OR OTHER PARTICIPANTS: Members of two unrelated families with HHRH participated in the study. RESULTS: Two affected siblings in one family were homozygous for a 101 bp deletion in intron 9. Haplotype analysis of the SLC34A3 locus in the family showed that the two deletions are on different haplotypes. An unrelated individual with HHRH was a compound heterozygote for an 85 bp deletion in intron 10 and a G-to-A substitution at the last nucleotide of exon 7. The deletion of intron 9 (and probably both other mutations) identified in this study causes aberrant RNA splicing. Sequence analysis of the deleted regions revealed the presence of direct repeats of homologous sequences. CONCLUSION: HHHR is caused by biallelic mutations in the SLC34A3 gene. Haplotype analysis suggests that the two intron 9 deletions arose independently. The identification of three independent deletions in introns 9 and 10 suggests that the SLC34A3 gene may be susceptible to unequal crossover due to sequence misalignment during meiosis.\n",
      "Experimental and clinical evidence highlights the role of the central histaminergic system in the pathogenesis of schizophrenia. The present study was designed to investigate the effect of histamine H(3) receptor ligands on neuroleptic-induced catalepsy, apomorphine-induced climbing behavior, and amphetamine-induced locomotor activities. in mice. Catalepsy was induced by haloperidol (2 mg/kg po), while apomorphine (1.5 mg/kg s.c.) and amphetamine (2 mg/kg s.c.) were used respectively to study the behavior climbing and locomotor activities. (R)-alpha-methylhistamine (RAMH) (5 microg icv) and thiooperamide (THP) (15 mg/kg i.p.), per se, did not cause catalepsy. Administration of THP (3.75, 7.5, and 15 mg/kg i.p.) 1 h before haloperidol resulted in a dose-dependent increase in catalepsy times (P < 0.05). However, pretreatment with RAMH significantly reversed this effect of THP (15 mg/kg i.p.). RAMH per se showed a significant reduction in locomotor time, distance traveled and average speed, but THP (15 mg/kg i.p.) per se had no effect on these parameters. On amphetamine-induced hyperactivity, THP (3.75 and 7.5 mg/kg i.p.) reduced locomotor time, distance traveled and average speed (P < 0.05). Pretreatment with RAMH (5 microg icv) could partially reverse these effects of THP (3.75 mg/kg ip). Apomorphine-induced climbing behavior was reduced in THP-treated animals. Such an effect was, however, reversed in the presence of RAMH. THP exhibited an antipsychotic-like profile by potentiating haloperidol-induced catalepsy, reducing amphetamine-induced hyperactivity, and reducing apomorphine-induced escalation in mice. These effects of THP were reversed by RAMH, indicating the involvement of histamine H(3) receptors. The results suggest potential for H(3) receptor antagonists in improving refractory cases of schizophrenia.\n",
      "PURPOSE: Extrapyramidal syndrome (EPS) is most commonly affected by typical antipsychotic medications that have a high affinity to the D2 receptor. Recently, many research groups have reported the positive relationship between genetic variations of the DRD2 gene and therapeutic response in schizophrenia patients due to the role of receptor variations in modulating receptor expression. In this study, we evaluate the role that DRD2 plays in chlorpromazine-induced EPS in schizophrenia patients. METHODS: We identified seven SNPs (single nucleotide polymorphism) (-141Cins>del, TaqIB, TaqID, Ser311Cys, rs6275, rs6277 and TaqIA) in the DRD2 gene in 146 hospitalized schizophrenia patients (59 with EPS and 87 without EPS according to the study Simpson- Angus Scale) treated with chlorpromazine after 8 weeks. Alleles of all loci were determined by PCR (polymerase chain reaction). RESULTS: TaqID, Ser311Cys and rs6277 polymorphisms were not polymorphic in the population recruited in the present study. No statistical significance was found in the distribution of alleles of -141Cins>del, TaqIB, rs6275 and TaqIA or in the estimated haplotypes (consisting of TaqIB, rs6275 and TaqIA) in case of linkage disequilibrium between the two groups. CONCLUSION: Our results do not strongly support the idea that genetic variation in the DRD2 gene plays a major role in the individually variable adverse effect induced by chlorpromazine, at least in Chinese patients with schizophrenia. Our results confirmed a previous study on the relationship between DRD2 and EPS in Caucasians.\n",
      "Eslicarbazepine acetate (BIA 2-093, S-(-)-10-acetoxy-10,11-dihydro-5H-dibenzo/b,f/azepine-5-carboxamide) is a new antiepileptic drug, currently in phase III clinical trials. , designed with the aim of improving efficacy and safety compared to the structurally related drugs carbamazepine (CBZ) and oxcarbazepine (OXC). We investigated the effects of oral eslicarbazepine acetate treatment in a whole animal model in which partial seizures can be repeatedly induced on different days without changes in seizure threshold or patterns. In animals treated with threshold doses of picrotoxin, the mean number of seizures was 2.3+/-1.2 and the mean seizure duration was 39.5+/-8.4 s. Pretreatment with a dose of 30 mg/kg 2 hours before microinfusion of picrotoxin prevented convulsions in 75% of rats. Lower doses (3 and 10 mg/kg) did not suppress seizures. However, after administration of 10 mg/kg, significant reductions in seizure duration (24.3+/-6.8 s) and seizure number (1.6+/-0.34) were observed. observed. No adverse effects of eslicarbazepine acetate were observed in the behavioral/EEG patterns studied, including sleep/wake cycle, at the doses studied.\n",
      "A recent addition to the list of widely confirmed type 1 diabetes risk loci is the PTPN22 gene encoding a lymphoid-specific phosphatase (Lyp). However, evidence supporting the role of PTPN22 in type 1 diabetes comes entirely from the study of a single coding single nucleotide polymorphism, 1858C/T. In the present study, the haplotype structure of the PTPN22 region was determined and individual haplotypes were tested for their association with type 1 diabetes in family testing. The 1858T risk allele occurred on a single haplotype strongly associated with type 1 diabetes (P = 7.9 x 10(-5)). After controlling for the effects of this allele, two other haplotypes were found to be weakly associated with type 1 diabetes (P < 0.05). Sequencing of the PTPN22 coding region on these haplotypes revealed a novel variant (2250G/C) that is predicted to result in a nonsynonymous amino acid substitution. Analysis of PTPN22 transcripts from a subject heterozygous for this variant indicated that it interfered with normal mRNA splicing, resulting in a premature termination codon after exon 17. These results support the conclusion that the The 1858C/T allele is the major risk variant for type 1 diabetes. in the PTPN22 locus, but they suggest that other uncommon coding variants at PTPN22 may also contribute to the risk of type 1 diabetes.\n",
      "Polymorphisms in proinflammatory cytokine genes have been shown to be associated with the risk of gastric cancer, among which changes in IL1B-31T/C and IL1B-511C/T have been well studied due to the possibility that they can alter IL1B transcription. The signal transduction target upon stimulation of interleukin 1 beta (IL1beta), nuclear factor kappa B (NFkappaB), supports cancer development, with signal transduction mediated by signaling of cell surface antigen (FAS) associated with FS-7 cells. Based on recent articles describing the prognostic roles of NFkappaB polymorphisms and functions on cancer development, we sought to determine whether Japanese gastric cancer patients were affected by IL1B -31/-511 polymorphisms. and FAS-670. A case-control study was conducted on patients with gastric adenocarcinoma (n = 271) and age- and gender-matched control subjects (n = 271). We observed strong linkage disequilibrium between the T allele at -511 and the C allele at -31 and between the C allele at -511 and the T allele at -31 in IL1B in cases and controls ( R(2) = 0.94). . Neither IL1B-31, -511 nor FAS-670 polymorphisms showed significantly different risks of gastric adenocarcinoma. Although FAS-670 polymorphisms showed no significant differences, the proportion of subjects with IL1B-31TT (or IL1B-511CC) increased depending on stage (P trend = 0.019). In particular, stage IV subjects had twice the likelihood of having the IL1B-31TT (or IL1B-511CC) genotype compared to stage I subjects. These observations suggest that IL1B-31TT and IL1B -511CC are associated with disease progression.\n",
      "X-linked mental retardation is traditionally divided into syndromic (S-XLMR) and non-syndromic (NS-XLMR) forms, although the boundaries between these phenotypes are beginning to disappear and mutations in a single gene, e.g. PQBP1 , can cause S. -XLMR as well as NS-XLMR. Here we report two maternal cousins ​​with an apparently X-linked phenotype of mental retardation (MR), microphthalmia, choroid coloboma, microcephaly, renal hypoplasia, and spastic paraplegia. By multipoint linkage analysis with markers covering the entire X chromosome, we mapped the disease locus to a 28 Mb interval between Xp11.4 and Xq12, including the BCOR gene. A BCOR missense mutation was described in a family with Lenz microphthalmia syndrome, a phenotype with substantial overlapping features with those described in the two cousins. However, no BCOR gene mutations were found in either patient. Subsequent analysis of mutations in PQBP1, located within the bounded binding interval in Xp11.23, revealed a 2-bp deletion, c.461_462delAG, which was associated with disease. Notably, the same mutation is associated with Hamel cerebropalatocardiac syndrome, another form of S-XLMR. Haplotype analysis suggests germline mosaicism of the 2 bp deletion in the maternal grandmother of the two affected individuals. In summary, our results demonstrate for the first time that PQBP1 mutations are associated with an S-XLMR phenotype including microphthalmia, thus expanding the clinical spectrum of phenotypes associated with PQBP1 mutations.\n",
      "Chloroacetaldehyde (CAA) is a metabolite of the alkylating agent ifosfamide (IFO) and potentially responsible for renal damage following antitumor treatment with IFO. Depletion of sulfhydryl (SH) groups has been reported in cell culture, animal and clinical studies. In this work, the effect of CAA on primary cultured human proximal tubule cells (hRPTEC) was investigated. CAA toxicity was determined by protein content, cell number, LDH release, trypan blue exclusion test, and caspase-3 activity. Free thiols were measured by the Ellman method. CAA reduced the number of hRPTEC cells and proteins, induced a loss of free intracellular thiols and an increase in necrosis markers. CAA, but not acrolein, inhibited the cysteine ​​proteases, caspase-3, caspase-8, and cathepsin B. Activation of caspase by cisplatin was inhibited by CAA. In cells stained with fluorescent dyes targeting lysosomes, CAA induced an increase in lysosomal size and lysosomal escape. The effects of CAA on cysteine ​​protease and thiol activities could be reproduced in cell lysate. Acidification, which slowed the reaction of CAA with thiol donors, could also attenuate the effects of CAA on necrosis markers, thiol depletion, and cysteine ​​protease inhibition in living cells. Thus, CAA reacts directly with cellular proteins and non-protein thiols, mediating its toxicity on hRPTEC. This effect can be reduced by acidification. Therefore, urinary acidification could be an option to prevent IFO nephropathy in patients.\n",
      "We report a case of Gitelman syndrome (GS) in a dizygotic twin who presented at the age of 12 years with failure to thrive, metabolic alkalosis, hypomagnesemia and hypokalemia with inappropriate kaliuresis and idiopathic intracranial hypertension. with bilateral papilledema (pseudotumor cerebri). The patient, her twin sister and her mother also had cerebral cavernous malformations. Given its early onset and normocalciuria, Bartter syndrome was diagnosed first. However, mutation analysis showed that the proband is a compound heterozygote for 2 mutations in SLC12A3: a serine to leucine substitution at amino acid position 555 (p.Ser555Leu) and a novel guanine transition to cytosine at the 5' splice site of intron 22. (c.2633+1G>C), providing the molecular diagnosis of GS. These mutations were not detected in 200 normal chromosomes and were distributed within the family. Analysis of complementary DNA showed that the heterozygous nucleotide change c.2633+1G>C caused the appearance of 2 RNA molecules, 1 normal transcript and 1 skipping the entire exon 22 ( r.2521_2634del). Potassium and magnesium supplementation improved clinical symptoms and resulted in catch-up growth, but vision remained impaired. Three similar associations between Bartter syndrome/GS and pseudotumor cerebri have been found in the literature, suggesting that electrolyte abnormalities and secondary aldosteronism may play a role in idiopathic intracranial hypertension. This study provides additional evidence for the phenotypic heterogeneity of GS and its association with severe manifestations in children. This also shows independent segregation of familial cavernomatosis and GS.\n",
      "Immunocompromised kidney transplant recipients (RTRs) are predisposed to non-melanoma skin cancers (NMSCs), primarily squamous cell carcinomas (SCCs). We analyzed skin lesions of RTRs with aggressive tumors for p53 gene changes, the presence of human papillomavirus (HPV) DNA in relation to p53 codon 72 genotype, and XPD repair gene polymorphisms. . We detected 24 p53 mutations in 15/25 (60%) NMSCs, 1 deletion and 23 base substitutions, the majority (78%) being UV-specific C to T transitions at bipyrimidine sites. Importantly, 35% (6/17) are tandem mutations, including 4 UV-signature CC to TT transitions possibly linked to modulated DNA repair caused by the immunosuppressive drug cyclosporin A (CsA). We found 8 p53 mutations in 7 out of 17 (41%) precancerous actinic keratoses (AKs), suggesting that p53 mutations are early events in RTR skin carcinogenesis. Immunohistochemical analysis shows a good correlation between p53 accumulation and mutations. HPV DNA was detected in 78% of skin lesions (60% basal cell carcinomas, 82% AKs, and 79% SCCs). Thus, immunosuppression increased the risk of HPV infections, mainly epidermodysplasia verruciformis, suspected of playing a role in the development of skin cancer. No association was found between HPV status and p53 mutation. Furthermore, p53 codon 72 or the frequencies of three XPD genotypes of RTR are comparable to those of control populations. The p53 mutation spectrum, showing a high level of CC to TT mutations, shows that the UV component of sunlight is the main risk factor and that modulated DNA repair by immunosuppressive drug treatment may be significant in the skin carcinogenesis of RTR.\n",
      "Nonketotic hyperglycinemia is a disorder of amino acid metabolism in which a defect in the glycine cleavage system results in accumulation of glycine in the brain and other body compartments. In the classic form, it manifests as neonatal apnea, intractable convulsions and hypotonia, followed by significant psychomotor delay. A significant subgroup of children with nonketotic hyperglycinemia are atypical variants that present heterogeneously. This report describes a patient with mild language delay and mental retardation who was found to have nonketotic hyperglycinemia following her presentation with acute encephalopathy and chorea shortly after initiation of valproate therapy.\n",
      "BACKGROUND: Meningococcal disease occurs after colonization of the nasopharynx by Neisseria meningitidis. Surfactant proteins (SP)-A and SP-D are airway pattern recognition molecules that activate inflammatory and phagocytic defenses after binding to microbial sugars. Variation in surfactant protein genes affects the expression and function of these molecules. METHODS: Allelic frequencies of SP-A1, SP-A2, and SP-D were determined by polymerase chain reaction in 303 patients with microbiologically proven meningococcal disease, including 18 deceased patients and 222 healthy control subjects. RESULTS: Homozygosity of the 1A1 allele of SP-A2 increased the risk of meningococcal disease (odds ratio [OR], 7.4; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.3-42.4) ; Carrying 1A5 reduced the risk (OR, 0.3; 95% CI, 0.1-0.97). An analysis of multiple SP-A single-nucleotide polymorphisms demonstrated that homozygosity of alleles encoding lysine (in 1A1) rather than glutamine (in 1A5) at amino acid 223 in the protein recognition domain carbohydrates was associated with an increased risk of meningococcal disease (OR, 6.7; 95% CI, 1.4-31.5). Carriage of alleles encoding lysine at residue 223 was seen in 61% of patients who died, compared with 35% of those who survived (age-adjusted OR, 2.9; 95% CI). , 1.1-7.7). Genetic variation in SP-A1 and SP-D was not associated with meningococcal disease. CONCLUSIONS: Genetic polymorphism resulting in the substitution of glutamine for lysine at residue 223 in the carbohydrate recognition domain of SP-A2 increases susceptibility to meningococcal disease, as well as the risk of death.\n",
      "OBJECTIVE: The authors compared the results of 4-month treatment with olanzapine versus risperidone in patients with a first episode of schizophrenia spectrum disorders. METHOD: One hundred and twelve subjects (70% male; mean age = 23.3 years [SD = 5.1]) with a first episode of schizophrenia (75%), schizophreniform disorder (17%), or schizo- (8%) were randomly assigned to treatment with olanzapine (2.5 to 20 mg/day) or risperidone (1 to 6 mg/day). RESULTS: Response rates did not differ significantly between olanzapine (43.7%, 95% CI = 28.8% to 58.6%) and risperidone (54.3%, 95% CI = 39 .9% to 68.7%). Among those who responded to treatment, more subjects in the olanzapine group (40.9%, 95% CI = 16.8% - 65.0%) than in the risperidone group (18.9%, 95% CI = 16.8% - 65.0%) % = 0% - 39.2%) received subsequent non-compliant assessments. response criteria. Negative symptom scores and measures of parkinsonism and akathisia did not differ between medications. Extrapyramidal symptom severity scores were 1.4 (95% CI = 1.2-1.6) with risperidone and 1.2 (95% CI = 1.0-1.4) with l olanzapine. Significantly greater weight gain was observed with olanzapine than with risperidone: the increase in weight at 4 months compared to initial weight was 17.3% (95% CI = 14.2% - 20.5%) with olanzapine and 11.3% (95% CI = 8.4% - 14.3%) with risperidone. Body mass index at baseline and 4 months was 24.3 (95% CI = 22.8-25.7) compared to 28.2 (95% CI = 26.7-29.7) with olanzapine and 23.9 (95% CI = 22.5-25.3) versus 26.7 (95% CI =25.2-28.2) with risperidone. CONCLUSIONS: Clinical results with risperidone were equal to those with olanzapine, and the response may be more stable. Olanzapine may have an advantage in motor side effects. Both drugs caused rapid and substantial weight gain, but weight gain was greater with olanzapine.\n",
      "Systemic sclerosis (SSc) is a connective tissue disease characterized by early widespread microangiopathy with disrupted angiogenesis. The endoglin gene (ENG) encodes a transmembrane glycoprotein that acts as an accessory receptor for the transforming growth factor beta (TGF-beta) superfamily and is crucial for the maintenance of vascular integrity. A 6-base insertion in intron 7 (6bINS) of ENG has been reported to be associated with microvascular disruption. OBJECTIVES: Our objective was to study the relationship between 6bINS and the vascular complication of pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) in SSc in a French Caucasian population. METHODS: Two hundred and eighty cases of SSc containing 29/280 with PAH diagnosed by catheterization were compared to 140 patients with osteoarthritis. Genotyping was performed by polymerase chain reaction-based fluorescence and direct sequencing of genomic DNA. RESULTS: Polymorphism was at Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium. We observed a significantly lower frequency of the 6bINS allele in SSc patients with associated PAH compared to controls [10.3 vs 23.9%, P = 0.01; odds ratio (OR) 0.37, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.15-0.89] and a trend compared to SSc patients without PAH (10.3 vs 20.3%, P = 0.05; OR: 0.45, 95% CI: 0.19-1.08). Genotypes carrying the 6bINS allele were also less common in SSc patients with PAH than in controls (20.7 vs. 42.9%, P = 0.02). CONCLUSIONS: Thus, the frequency of 6bINS differs between SSc patients with or without PAH, suggesting the involvement of ENG in this devastating vascular complication of SSc.\n",
      "Thyroid hormone resistance (THR) is an inherited syndrome characterized by elevated serum thyroid hormones (TH), failure to suppress pituitary secretion of thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), and variable peripheral tissue reactivity. at HT. The disorder is associated with various mutations in the thyroid hormone receptor beta (TRbeta). Here we report a novel natural RTH mutation (E333D) located in the large carboxy-terminal ligand binding domain of TRbeta. The mutation was identified in a 22-year-old French woman consulted because of increasing overweight. Biochemical tests showed elevated free thyroxine (T4: 20.8 pg/ml (normal, 8.5-18)) and triiodothyronine (T3: 5.7 pg/ml (normal, 1.4-18) 4)) in serum, as well as an inappropriately suppressed TSH level. 4.7 mU/ml (normal, 0.4-4). Serum tests from his father and brother also showed biochemical abnormalities consistent with RTH. Direct sequencing of the TRbeta gene revealed a heterozygous 1284A>C transition in exon 9 resulting in the substitution of glutamic acid 333 with the aspartic acid residue (E333D). Further functional analyzes of the new TRbeta mutant were carried out. We found that the E333D mutation did not significantly affect the affinity of the receptor for T3 or alter the formation of heterodimers with the retinoid X receptor (RXR) when bound to DNA. However, in transient transfection assays, the E333D TRbeta mutant exhibited altered transcriptional regulation on two distinct upregulated thyroid response elements (F2 and DR4-TRE) as well as the downregulated human TSHalpha promoter. Additionally, dominant inhibition of the transactivation function of the wild-type TRbeta homolog was observed on both a positive (F2-TRE) and negative (TSHalpha) promoter. These results strongly suggest that the E333D TRbeta mutation is responsible for the RTH phenotype in the proposita family.\n",
      "We previously reported a robust association between an allelic haplotype of “Disturbed in Schizophrenia 1” (DISC1) and schizophrenia in a nationwide collection of Finnish schizophrenia families. This specific DISC1 allele was subsequently identified as being associated with visual working memory, selectively in males. The DISC1 association with schizophrenia has since been replicated in several independent study samples from different populations. In this study, we conditioned our sample of Finnish families on the presence of the Finnish provisional risk allele for DISC1 and reanalyzed our genome-wide analysis data of 443 markers based on this stratification. Two additional loci showed evidence of linkage (LOD > 3) and included a locus on 16p13, close to the gene encoding NDE1, which has been shown to interact biologically with DISC1. Although none of the observed links remained significant after several simulation correction tests, further analysis of NDE1 revealed an association between a tag haplotype and schizophrenia (P = 0.00046) specific to women, which was was found to be significant (P = 0.011) after several tests. test correction. Our results would support the concept that initial genetic discoveries in multifactorial diseases will aid in the identification of other components of a complex genetic etiology. Notably, this and other converging lines of evidence highlight the importance of DISC1-related functional pathways in the etiology of schizophrenia.\n",
      "CYP1A1 activates environmental procarcinogens and catalyzes oxidative estrogen metabolism and is likely to play an important role in the etiology of prostate cancer. To evaluate this phenomenon, the association between two single nucleotide polymorphisms (A to G transition in exon7 leading to the substitution of amino acids Ile462Val and T3801C in 3'UTR) of the CYP1A1 gene in prostate cancer was analyzed in a case-control study involving 100 individuals South Indian population. The estimated relative risk was significantly elevated for individuals with a w1/m1 genotype at 3'UTR of the CYP1A1 gene (OR-4.64; 95% CI = 1.51-14.86; P < 0.01) while that the CYP1A1 Ile/Val (w2/m2) genotype on exon 7 was found to be associated with a decreased risk of prostate cancer (OR-0.17; 95% CI = 0.02-0.89; P = 0.03). Stratified analysis of genotypes with age of onset and tumor grade showed that the w1/m1 genotype was significantly associated with early age of onset; however, tumor grades did not have a significant association with variant genotypes. Thus, the present study indicates that individuals with the w1/m1 variant genotype have an increased risk, while those with the w2/m2 genotype have a reduced risk of prostate cancer.\n",
      "The aim of this study was to evaluate the interactive effects of chronic anabolic-androgenic steroid (AAS) exposure and cerebral serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine, 5-HT) depletion on the behavior of pubertal male rats. Serotonin was depleted from postnatal day 26 with parachlorophenylalanine (PCPA 100 mg/kg, every other day); controls received saline. At puberty (P40), half of the PCPA-treated rats and half of the saline-treated rats began testosterone treatment (T, 5 mg/kg, 5 days/week). Behavioral measures included locomotion, irritability, copulation, mate preference, and aggression. The animals were tested for aggression in their home cage, with and without physical provocation (light tail pinching). Brain levels of 5-HT and its metabolite, 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid (5-HIAA), were determined by HPLC. PCPA significantly and substantially reduced 5-HT and 5-HIAA levels in all brain regions examined. Chronic T treatment significantly decreased 5-HT and 5-HIAA in some brain areas, but to a much lesser extent than PCPA. Chronic exposure to PCPA alone significantly decreased locomotor activity and increased irritability, but had no effect on sexual behavior, partner preference, or aggression. T alone had no effect on locomotion, irritability, or sexual behavior, but increased partner preference and aggression. The most striking effect of the combination of T+PCPA was a significant increase in attack frequency as well as a significant decrease in pre-attack latency, particularly following physical provocation. Based on these data, it can be hypothesized that pubertal AAS users with low central 5-HT levels might be particularly prone to exhibit aggressive behavior.\n",
      "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a complex polygenic and multifactorial disease, the etiopathology of which is still unclear, but several genetic factors have been shown to increase the risk of developing the disease. Purine nucleotides and nucleosides play an important role in the brain. In addition to their role in neurotransmission and neuromodulation, they are involved in the release of trophic factors, apoptosis and inflammatory responses. These mediators may also play a central role in the control of neurodegenerative processes associated with AD. In this report, the distribution of exonic G/A single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in the purine nucleoside phosphorylase (PNP) gene, resulting in the substitution of the amino acid serine with glycine at position 51 (G51S), was investigated in a large AD population. patients (n = 321) and non-demented controls (n = 208). The distribution of PNP polymorphism was not different between patients and controls. Polymorphism distribution was also analyzed in AD patients stratified by differential progressive rate of cognitive decline during 2-year follow-up. An increased representation of the PNP AA genotype was observed in AD patients with rapid cognitive deterioration compared to that in patients with a slow rate of deterioration. Our results suggest that the G51S PNP polymorphism is associated with a faster rate of cognitive decline in AD patients, highlighting the important role of purine metabolism in the progression of this neurodegenerative disorder.\n",
      "OBJECTIVES:The risk of acute myocardial infarction (AMI) with COX-2 inhibitors may offset their gastrointestinal (GI) benefit compared with non-selective nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) (NS). Our objective was to compare the risks of hospitalization for AMI and gastrointestinal bleeding in elderly patients using COX-2 inhibitors, NS-NSAIDs, and acetaminophen. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective cohort study using administrative data of patients aged > or = 65 years who filled a prescription for NSAIDs or acetaminophen between 1999 and 2002. Results were compared using of Cox regression models with time-dependent exposures. RESULTS: Person-years of exposure among non-aspirin users were: 75,761 to acetaminophen, 42,671 to rofecoxib, 65,860 to celecoxib, and 37,495 to NS-NSAIDs. Among aspirin users, they were: 14,671 on rofecoxib, 22,875 on celecoxib, 9,832 on NS-NSAIDs and 38,048 on acetaminophen. Among aspirin non-users, the adjusted hazard ratios (95% confidence interval) for AMI/GI hospitalization compared to the acetaminophen group (no aspirin) were: rofecoxib 1.27 (1.13, 1 .42), celecoxib 0.93 (0.83, 1.03), naproxen 1.59 (1.31, 1.93), diclofenac 1.17 (0.99, 1.38) and ibuprofen 1.05 (0.74, 1.51). Among aspirin users, these were: rofecoxib 1.73 (1.52, 1.98), celecoxib 1.34 (1.19, 1.52), ibuprofen 1.51 (0.95, 2.41), diclofenac 1.69 (1.35, 2.10), naproxen 1.35 (0.97, 1.88) and acetaminophen 1.29 (1.17, 1.42). CONCLUSION: Among non-aspirin users, naproxen appeared to pose the highest risk of AMI/GI bleeding. The AMI/GI toxicity of celecoxib was similar to that of acetaminophen and appeared better than that of rofecoxib and NS-NSAIDs. Among aspirin users, celecoxib and naproxen appeared to be the least toxic.\n",
      "Eight Alu sequences (ACE, TPA25, PV92, APO, FXIIIB, D1, A25 and B65) were analyzed in two samples from the provinces of Navarra and Guipuzcoa (Basque Country, Spain). Alu data for other European, Caucasian, and North African populations were compiled from the literature for comparison to assess the genetic relationships of Basques in a broader geographic context. The results of the MDS plot and AMOVA revealed spatial heterogeneity between these three population groups clearly defined by geography. On the contrary, no substantial genetic heterogeneity was found between Basque samples, nor between Basques and other Europeans (excluding Caucasian populations). Furthermore, the genetic information obtained from Alu data conflicts with hypotheses linking the origin of the Basques to populations from North Africa (Berbers) or the Caucasus region (Georgia). To explain the reduced genetic heterogeneity detected by Alu insertions among Basque subpopulations, Wright's F(ST) statistic values ​​were estimated for Alu markers and a set of short tandem repeats ( STR) in terms of two geographical scales: (1) the Basque Country, (2) Europe (including the Basques). In the Basque region, Wahlund effect estimates for both genetic markers showed no statistical differences between Basque subpopulations. However, when this analysis was performed on a European scale, F(ST) values ​​were significantly higher for Alu insertions than for STR alleles. From these results, we suggest that the spatial heterogeneity of the Basque gene pool identified in previous studies on polymorphism is relatively recent and probably caused by a differential process of genetic admixture with neighboring non-Basque populations modulated by the effect from a language barrier to random mating. .\n",
      "There has been a reported case of severe malaria presenting with jaundice and experiencing arrhythmia (premature ventricular contraction) while receiving a quinine infusion. A 25-year-old man was admitted to hospital with high fever, chills, vomiting and jaundice. The patient was fully conscious, blood pressure 120/80 mmHg, pulse 100 x/minute, regular. On admission, laboratory examination showed Plasmodium falciparum (++++), total bilirubin 8.25 mg/dL, conjugated bilirubin 4.36 mg/dL, unconjugated bilirubin 3.89 mg/dL, potassium 3.52 meq/L. The patient was diagnosed as severe malaria with jaundice and given an infusion of quinine in dextrose 5% 500 mg/8 hours. On the second day, the patient experienced vomiting, diarrhea, tinnitus and hearing loss. After 30 hours of quinine infusion, the patient experienced palpitations and electrocardiographic (ECG) recording showed premature ventricular contraction (PVC) > 5 x/minute, trigemini, constant type - sinoatrial block, wave U positive. He was treated with 50 mg of lidocaine intravenously followed by an infusion of 1,500 mg in 5% dextrose/24 hours and one potassium aspartate tablet. The quinine infusion was stopped and replaced with quinine sulfate tablets. Three hours later the patient felt better, the PVC frequency was reduced to 4 - 5 x/minute and on the third day the ECG was normal, the potassium level was 3.34 meq/L. It came out on the 7th day in good condition. Quinine, like quinidine, is a chincona alkaloid that has antiarrhythmic properties, although it is also proarrhythmic and can cause various arrhythmias, including serious arrhythmias such as multiple PVCs. Administration of parenteral quinine should be carried out with caution and careful monitoring due to its pro-arrhythmic effect, particularly in elderly patients with cardiac diseases or in patients with an electrolyte disturbance (hypokalemia) which frequently occurs due to vomiting and/or diarrhea in cases of malaria.\n",
      "We report cytogenetic and molecular studies of a de novo, apparently balanced t(1;3)(q32.1;q25.1) identified in a 12-year-old female (designated DGAP128) presenting with cerebral atrophy, seizures of macrocephaly and developmental disorders. delay. A combination of fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) and Southern blot analysis demonstrated disruption of a synaptotagmin gene (SYT14) at breakpoint 1q32. The expression of SYT14 in human brain was confirmed by Northern analysis. Because members of the synaptotagmin family of proteins function as sensors that link changes in calcium levels to various biological processes, including neurotransmission and hormonal responsiveness, SYT14 is an intriguing candidate gene for this child's abnormal development. This is the first known constitutional rearrangement of SYT14, and systematic genetic analyzes and further clinical studies of DGAP128 may offer unique insights into the role of SYT14 in neurodevelopment.\n",
      "BACKGROUND: Methadone is prescribed to heroin addicts to reduce illicit opioid use. Prolongation of the QT interval in the ECG of patients with torsade de pointes (TdP) has been reported in methadone users. Because heroin addicts sometimes pass out while using illicit drugs, doctors might attribute too many syncope episodes to illicit drug use and thus underestimate the incidence of TdP in this particular population, and the high mortality in this population. population could, in part, be caused by the proarrhythmic effect of methadone. METHODS: In this cross-sectional study, ECGs and blood samples were collected from a population of adult heroin addicts treated daily with methadone or buprenorphine. Of the patients at the Copenhagen Municipality drug addiction service, 450 (approximately 52%) were included. The QT interval was estimated from 12 lead ECGs. All participants were asked about any experiences of syncope. The association between opioid dose and QT interval, as well as methadone dose and report of syncope was evaluated by multivariate linear regression and logistic regression, respectively. RESULTS: Methadone dose was associated with a 0.140 ms/mg longer QT interval (p = 0.002). No association between buprenorphine and QTc interval was found. Among methadone-treated subjects, 28% of men and 32% of women had a prolonged QTc interval. None of the subjects treated with buprenorphine had a QTc interval > 0.440 s ((1/2)). A higher methadone dose of 50 mg was associated with a 1.2 (95% CI: 1.1 to 1.4) times increased risk of syncope. CONCLUSIONS: Methadone is associated with QT prolongation and a higher rate of syncope in a heroin-dependent population.\n",
      "Bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs) are a highly conserved class of signaling molecules that induce ectopic cartilage and bone formation in vivo. Dysregulated expression of bone morphogenetic protein 4 (BMP4) is found in cells from patients with fibrodysplasia ossificans progressiva (FOP), a genetic disorder of axial and appendicular skeletal malformation and progressive heterotopic ossification. Loss-of-function mutations in the bone morphogenetic protein 5 (bmp5) gene leading to underexpression of BMP5 cause murine short ear syndrome, characterized by small, malformed ears and a wide range of axial skeletal malformations . We found features reminiscent of both mouse short ear and FOP in a child with malformed external ears, multiple axial skeletal malformations, and progressive heterotopic ossification of the neck and back. We examined BMP mRNA expression in transformed lymphocytes by semiquantitative RT-PCR and protein expression by ELISA and immunohistochemistry. High levels of BMP4 and BMP5 mRNA and protein were detected in the patient's cells, while BMP2 mRNA levels remained unchanged. Our data suggest that deregulated expression of BMP4 and BMP5 genes is associated with a set of human axial skeletal abnormalities similar to those in short-eared mice and FOP.\n",
      "To identify genetic variants contributing to end-stage renal disease (ESRD) in type 2 diabetes, we performed a genome-wide analysis of 115,352 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in groups of 105 unrelated cases with of ESRD and 102 unrelated control subjects who had suffered from type 2 diabetes for > or = 10 years without macroalbuminuria. Using a sliding window statistic of ranked SNPs, we identified a 200 kb region on 8q24 harboring three SNPs with substantial differences in allele frequency between the case and control pools. These SNPs were genotyped in individuals comprising each pool, and strong evidence of association was found with rs2720709 (P = 0.000021; odds ratio 2.57 [95% CI 1.66-3.96] ), which is located in the plasmacytoma variant translocation gene PVT1. We sequenced all exons, exon-intron boundaries, and the promoter of PVT1 and identified 47 variants, 11 of which represented non-redundant markers with a minor allele frequency > or = 0.05. We then genotyped these 11 variants along with 87 additional SNPs identified in public databases in the adjacent 319 kb rs2720709 (approximately 1 SNP/3.5 kb); 23 markers were associated with ESRD at P < 0.01. The strongest evidence of association was found for rs2648875 (P = 0.0000018; 2.97 [1.90-4.65]), which corresponds to intron 8 of PVT1. Together, these results suggest that PVT1 may contribute to susceptibility to ESRD in diabetes.\n",
      "BACKGROUND: Electrocardiography has very low sensitivity for detecting dobutamine-induced myocardial ischemia. OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the added diagnostic value of a new measure of cardiac performance index (dP/dtejc), based on changes in brachial artery flow, compared to standard 12-lead ECG, to detect dobutamine-induced myocardial ischemia, using simple Tc99m-Sestamibi. -photon emission computed tomography as a reference for comparison to assess the presence or absence of ischemia. METHODS: The study group included 40 patients undergoing Sestamibi-SPECT/dobutamine stress testing. Simultaneous measurements of ECG and brachial artery dP/dtejc were performed at each dobutamine level. In 19 of 40 patients, perfusion defects consistent with ischemia were detected by SPECT. The increase in dP/dtejc level during dobutamine infusion in this group was severely impaired compared to the nonischemic group. The dP/dtejc result was combined with the ECG results, giving an ECG-enhanced value, and compared to the ECG alone. RESULTS: Sensitivity improved significantly from 16% to 79%, positive predictive value increased from 60% to 68% and negative predictive value from 54% to 78%, and specificity decreased from 90% to 67%. %. CONCLUSIONS: If ECG alone is used for specificity, the combination with dP/dtejc improved the sensitivity of the test and could provide a cost-effective alternative to cardiac imaging or perfusion studies to detect myocardial ischemia, in particularly in patients unable to exercise.\n",
      "Van der Woude syndrome (VWS) is the most common type of orofacial syndromic cleft, accounting for approximately 2% of all cases of cleft lip and palate. It is characterized by a variable association of lower lip hollows, cleft lip and palate and hypodontia. VWS results from mutations in the gene encoding interferon regulatory factor 6 (IRF6). The disease is transmitted in an autosomal dominant manner, with high penetrance and variable expressivity. Very recently, mutations in the IRF6 gene in exons 2 to 9 were discovered in patients with VWS, suggesting that this gene plays an important role in orofacial development. We report a novel mutation of the IRF6 gene in a German family. Five of the 12 people concerned were able to be investigated. The mutation produced a stop codon in exon 4 of the IRF6 gene. All 5 patients were heterozygous for a c.201C>A base substitution changing the tyrosine codon at amino acid position 67 to a stop codon (p.Y67X) in exon 4. The premature stop codon was responsible for a truncated protein lacking parts of the DNA-binding domain and the complete Smad interferon regulatory factor-binding domain are likely essential for interactions with Smad transcription factors.\n",
      "BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES:A number of antibodies against microbial epitopes or self-antigens have been associated with Crohn's disease. The development of antibodies reflects a loss of tolerance to the gut bacteria that cause Crohn's disease, leading to an exaggerated adaptive immune response to these bacteria. It has been hypothesized that the development of antimicrobial antibodies is influenced by the presence of genetic variants in pattern recognition receptor genes. The aim of this study was therefore to investigate the influence of mutations in these innate immune receptor genes (nucleotide oligomerization domain (NOD) 2/caspase recruitment domain (CARD) 15, NOD1/CARD4, TUCAN/ CARDINAL/CARD8, Toll-like receptor (TLR) 4, TLR2, TLR1 and TLR6) on the development of antimicrobial and antiglycan antibodies in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Materials and Methods: A cohort of 1,163 unrelated IBD patients (874 Crohn's disease, 259 ulcerative colitis, 30 indeterminate colitis) and 312 controls were analyzed for anti-Saccharomyces cerevisiae (gASCA) IgG antibodies, anti-Saccharomyces cerevisiae (gASCA) IgG antibodies, -laminaribioside (ALCA) IgG, anti-chitobioside (ACCA) IgA, anti-mannobioside (AMCA) IgG and outer membrane porin (Omp) IgA and were genotyped for NOD2/CARD15, TUCAN variants /CARDINAL/CARD8, NOD1/CARD4, TLR4, TLR1, TLR2 and TLR6. RESULTS: Compared to Crohn's disease patients without CARD15 mutations, the presence of at least one CARD15 variant in Crohn's disease patients more frequently led to gASCA positivity (66.1% vs. 51.5 %, p < 0.0001) and ALCA positivity (43.3% versus 34.9%). , p = 0.018) and higher gASCA titers (85.7 versus 51.8 ELISA units, p < 0.0001), independently of ileal involvement. A gene dosage effect, with increasing positivity of gASCA and ALCA for patients carrying none, one and two CARD15 variants, respectively, was observed for both markers. Similarly, Crohn's disease patients carrying the NOD1/CARD4 indel had a higher prevalence of gASCA antibodies than wild-type patients (63.8% vs. 55.2%, p = 0.014), also with a gene dosage effect. An opposite effect was observed for the TLR4 D299G and TLR2 P631H variants, with a lower prevalence of ACCA antibodies (23.4% versus 35%, p = 0.013) and Omp antibodies (20.5% versus 34.6% , p = 0.009), respectively. CONCLUSION:Variants in innate immune receptor genes influence the formation of antibodies against microbial epitopes. In this regard, it is curious that an opposite effect of CARD15 and TLR4 variants was observed. These results could contribute to the understanding of the etiology of seroreactivity observed in IBD.\n",
      "To develop a novel and effective drug that could improve cognitive function and neuroprotection, we recently synthesized maltolyl p-coumarate by esterification of maltol and p-coumaric acid. In the present study, we examined whether maltolyl p-coumarate could ameliorate cognitive decline in scopolamine-injected rats and in beta-amyloid peptide-infused rats (1-42). Maltolyl p-coumarate was found to attenuate cognitive deficits in both rat models using a passive avoidance test and reduced apoptotic cell death observed in the hippocampus of beta peptide-infused rats. -amyloid (1-42). We also examined the neuroprotective effects of maltolyl p-coumarate in vitro using SH-SY5Y cells. Cells were pretreated with maltolyl p-coumarate, before being exposed to beta-amyloid peptide (1-42), glutamate or H2O2. We found that maltolyl p-coumarate significantly decreased apoptotic cell death and reduced reactive oxygen species, cytochrome c release, and caspase 3 activation. Pooling these in vitro and in vivo results, our study suggests that maltolyl p-coumarate is a potentially effective candidate against Alzheimer's disease characterized by widespread neuronal death and progressive decline in cognitive function.\n",
      "Polymorphism of the manganese superoxide dismutase (Mn-SOD) gene is a novel approach to identify its probable association with urolithiasis. Oxidative stress may be involved in the development of stone formation in the renal system. MnSOD is one of the main enzymes that directly remove potentially harmful oxidative species. A substitution of valine (Val) for alanine (Ala) at amino acid 16, occurring in the mitochondrial targeting sequence of the MnSOD gene, has been associated with an increased risk of urolithiasis. This study was conducted to investigate the association of MnSOD gene polymorphism with the risk of urolithiasis. We studied MnSOD in 66 stone-forming adults and 72 healthy volunteers. DNA was isolated from peripheral blood and genotyping was performed using PCR-based methods. Then, the PCR products were cut by BsaW1. The products were analyzed on a 3% agarose gel, the 246 bp regions were 1-Ala-9, the 164 and 82 bp products were determined to be 2 Val-9. The Chi-square test was used for comparison between patients and controls. In the control group, the homozygous Ala allele was significantly higher than in the patient group (P < 0.01). The distribution of Ala/Val and homozygous Val alleles in the patient group was significantly higher than in the control group (P < 0.05). Determination of the MnSOD genotype may provide a tool to identify individuals at risk for urolithiasis. This experiment also provides data on antioxidant status and stone formation.\n",
      "PURPOSE: Breast cancer prognosis varies widely among individuals, and inherited genetic factors may help explain this variability. Genes involved in defense against reactive oxygen species (ROS) are of particular interest, as ROS are thought to cause DNA damage and contribute to cancer pathogenesis. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We examined associations between 54 polymorphisms that mark known common variants (minor allele frequency > 0.05) in 10 genes involved in oxidative damage repair (CAT, SOD1, SOD2, GPX1, GPX4, GSR , TXN, TXN2, TXNRD1, and TXNRD2) and survival in 4,470 women with of breast cancer. RESULTS: Two single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in GPX4 (rs713041 and rs757229) were associated with all-cause mortality, even after adjustment for testing multiple hypotheses (adjusted P = 0.0041 and P = 0.0035). These SNPs are correlated with each other (r2 = 0.61). GPX4 rs713041 is located near the selenocysteine ​​insertion sequence element in the 3' untranslated region of GPX4, and the rare allele of this SNP is associated with an increased risk of death, with a relative risk of 1 .27 per rare allele carried (95% CI, 1.13). at 11:43 a.m.). This effect was not attenuated after adjusting for tumor stage, grade, or estrogen receptor status. We found that the common allele is preferentially expressed in normal lymphocytes, normal breast, and breast tumors compared to the rare allele, but there was no difference in total GPX4 mRNA levels according to genotypes. CONCLUSION: These data strongly support the hypothesis that a common variation in GPX4 is associated with prognosis after breast cancer diagnosis.\n",
      "Mutations in the GJB2 gene are the most common cause of hereditary prelingual sensorineural hearing loss in Europe. Several studies indicate that different members of the connexin protein family interact to form gap junctions in the inner ear. Mutations in different connexin genes can accumulate and consequently lead to hearing loss. Therefore, we examined 47 Hungarian GJB2 heterozygous (a mutation in the coding exon of the GJB2 gene) patients with hearing loss for DNA changes in two other connexin genes (GJB6 and GJB3) and in the region non-coding 5' of GJB2, including splice sites. Eleven of the 47 GJB2 heterozygous patients analyzed carried the -3170G>A splice site mutation in the 5'UTR region of GJB2. One of these 11 patients presented a homozygous genotype -3170G>A in association with p.R127H. Alongside the GJB2 mutations, we noted 2 cases of deletion in GJB6 [Delta(GJB6-D13S1830)] and 3 base substitutions (2 new and 1 described) in GJB3 [c.357C>T, c.798C>T and c.94C >T (p.R32W)] which are unlikely to cause disease. Our results suggest the importance of systematic screening for the -3170G>A mutation, which is rather common (in addition to c.35delG) in hearing-impaired patients.\n",
      "Achondroplasia is the most common form of dwarfism and has an incidence of approximately 1/7,500. In more than 98% of cases, the disease is associated with a G to A or G to C substitution at nucleotide position 1138 (p.G380R) of the fibroblast growth factor receptor 3 (FGFR3) gene. We have developed a sensitive single-tube tetra-primer PCR assay to detect both the c.1138G>A and c.1138G>C mutations and can successfully distinguish between DNA samples homozygous and heterozygous for the c.1138G mutation. >A. Titration studies showed that the assay could reliably detect one copy of the mutant allele in a mixture of 100 wild-type alleles. The test was tested in 50 healthy controls, 3 known patients with achondroplasia and 5 amniotic fluids suspected of achondroplasia and for whom we had previously determined the genotypes of the c.1138G>A mutation by PCR-RFLP. We observed complete agreement between the methods. Our tetra-primer PCR assay is a sensitive, inexpensive and easy-to-use method for FGFR3 p.G380R genotyping, which could be used even in “low-tech” laboratories.\n",
      "This was an exploratory study to investigate lamivudine-resistant hepatitis B virus (HBV) strains in selected lamivudine-naïve HBV carriers with and without human immunodeficiency virus co-infection (HIV) in South African patients. Thirty-five lamivudine-naïve HBV-infected patients, with or without HIV co-infection, were studied: 15 chronic HBV mono-infected patients and 20 HBV-HIV co-infected patients. This latter group was subdivided into 13 patients with occult HBV (HBsAg negative) and 7 patients obviously infected with HBV (HBsAg positive). HBsAg, anti-HBs, anti-HBc, and anti-HIV 1/2 were determined as part of routine diagnosis using Axsym assays (Abbott Laboratories, North Chicago, IL). Serum samples were amplified by PCR with HBV reverse transcriptase (RT) primers, followed by direct sequencing through the tyrosine-methionine-aspartate-aspartate (YMDD) motif of the major catalytic region of the C domain of the HBV RT enzyme. HBV viral load was performed with the Amplicor HBV Monitor v2.0 test (Roche Diagnostics, Penzberg, Germany). Lamivudine-resistant HBV strains were detected in 3 of 15 mono-infected chronic hepatitis B patients and 10 of 20 patients co-infected with HBV and HIV. To our knowledge, this is the first report of lamivudine-resistant HBV strains in treatment-naïve HBV-HIV co-infected patients. HBV viral loads in mono-infected and co-infected patients ranged from 3.32 x 10(2) to 3.82 x 10(7) and <200 to 4.40 x 10(3) copies/ml, respectively. . It remains to be seen whether such pre-existing antiviral mutations could lead to the widespread emergence of HBV-resistant strains when lamivudine-containing highly active antiretroviral (ARV) regimens (HAART) become widely implemented in South Africa, as this may have potential implications in the management of HBV-HIV co-infected patients.\n",
      "People with HIV can now live long lives thanks to drug treatment that often includes protease inhibitors such as ritonavir. However, many patients develop long-term negative side effects, such as premature atherosclerosis. We have previously demonstrated that ritonavir treatment increases atherosclerotic lesion formation in male mice more than in female mice. Additionally, peripheral blood monocytes isolated from ritonavir-treated females showed less accumulation of cholesteryl esters. In the present study, we investigated the molecular mechanisms by which female hormones influence cholesterol metabolism in macrophages in response to ritonavir, an HIV protease inhibitor. We used the human monocytic cell line THP-1 as a model to answer this question. Briefly, cells were differentiated for 72 h with 100 nM PMA to obtain a macrophage-like phenotype in the presence or absence of 1 nM 17beta-estradiol (E2), 100 nM progesterone, or vehicle (0 .01% ethanol). Cells were then treated with 30 ng/ml ritonavir or vehicle in the presence of aggregated LDL for 24 h. Cell extracts were harvested and lipid or total RNA was isolated. E2 decreased cholesteryl ester accumulation in macrophages after ritonavir treatment. Ritonavir increased the expression of the scavenger receptor, CD36 mRNA, which is responsible for LDL uptake. Additionally, ritonavir treatment selectively increased the relative mRNA levels of PPARgamma, a transcription factor responsible for regulating CD36 mRNA expression. Treatment with E2, however, failed to prevent these increases at the mRNA level. E2, however, significantly suppressed CD36 protein levels measured by fluorescent immunocytochemistry. These data suggest that E2 alters CD36 expression at the level of protein expression in monocyte-derived macrophages, resulting in reduced cholesteryl ester accumulation after ritonavir treatment.\n",
      "PAX9 and MSX1 are transcription factors that play essential roles in craniofacial and limb development. In humans, mutations in both genes are associated with non-syndromic and syndromic oligodontia, respectively. We examined a family with nonsyndromic oligodontia for mutations in PAX9 and MSX1. Single-strand conformational polymorphism (SSCP) analysis and sequencing revealed a novel C139T heterozygous transition in PAX9 in affected family members. No mutations were detected in the entire MSX1 coding sequence. The C139T mutation, which is predicted to result in the substitution of an arginine for a tryptophan (R47W) in the N-terminal subdomain, affected conserved residues in the PAX9 paired domain. To elucidate the pathogenic mechanism producing the oligodontia phenotype caused by this mutation, we analyzed the binding of wild-type and mutant PAX9 paired domain protein to double-stranded DNA targets. The R47W mutation significantly reduced DNA binding, suggesting that the mutant protein, with consequent haploinsufficiency, results in a clinical phenotype.\n",
      "BACKGROUND:Focal cutaneous hypoplasia (FDH) (OMIM 305600) is an X-linked dominant disorder of ecto-mesodermal development. Also known as Goltz syndrome, FDH presents with characteristic linear striations of the hypoplastic dermis and variable abnormalities of the bones, nails, hair, limbs, teeth, and eyes. The molecular basis of FDH involves mutations in the PORCN gene, which encodes an enzyme enabling membrane targeting and secretion of several Wnt proteins essential for normal tissue development. OBJECTIVES: To investigate the molecular basis of FDH in a 2-year-old Thai girl who presented at birth with pale, depressed linear scars on the trunk and limbs, thinning and brittle hair, syndactyly of the right middle finger and of the ring finger, dental caries and radiological characteristics of striatal osteopathy. METHODS: Sequencing genomic DNA from the affected individual and both parents to search for disease-causing mutations in the PORCN gene. RESULTS: DNA sequencing revealed a heterozygous G>T substitution at nucleotide c.898 in exon 10 (NM_203475.1), converting a glutamic acid (GAA) residue to a premature termination codon (TAA ). This mutation, called p.E300X, was not detected in the DNA of either parent or in 100 control chromosomes. CONCLUSION: The identification of this novel de novo nonsense mutation confirms the diagnosis of FDH in this child and highlights the clinical importance of the PORCN and Wnt signaling pathways in embryogenesis.\n",
      "BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Methylating agents are effective chemotherapy agents for Hodgkin lymphoma, but are associated with the development of second primary cancers. The cytotoxicity of methylating agents is mainly mediated by the DNA mismatch repair (MMR) system. Loss of MLH1, a major component of MMR DNA, results in tolerance to the cytotoxic effects of methylating agents and the persistence of mutagenized cells at high risk of malignant transformation. We hypothesized that a common substitution in the basal promoter of MLH1 (position -93, rs1800734) modifies cancer risk after methylating chemotherapy. METHODS: 133 patients who developed cancer following chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy (n = 133), 420 patients diagnosed with de novo myeloid leukemia, 242 patients diagnosed with primary Hodgkin lymphoma and 1177 healthy controls were genotyped for the MLH1 -93 polymorphism by allelic. polymerase chain reaction (PCR) discrimination and restriction fragment length polymorphism testing. Odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals for cancer risk based on MLH1 -93 polymorphism status, and stratified by prior exposure to methylating chemotherapy, were calculated using an unconditional logistic regression. RESULTS: The frequency of MLH1 -93 variant carriers was higher in patients who developed treatment-related acute myeloid leukemia (t-AML) (75.0%, n = 12) or breast cancer (53.3 % n = 15) after methylation chemotherapy for Hodgkin. lymphoma compared to patients without prior methylation exposure (t-AML, 30.4%, n = 69; breast cancer patients, 27.2%, n = 22). The MLH1 -93 variant allele was also overrepresented in t-AML cases compared to de novo AML cases (36.9%, n=420) and healthy controls (36.3%, n=952), and was associated with a significantly increased risk of developing tAML (odds ratio 5.31, 95% confidence interval 1.40 to 20.15), but only in patients previously treated with a methylating agent. CONCLUSIONS: These data support the hypothesis that the common polymorphism at position -93 in the MLH1 core promoter defines a risk allele for cancer development after methylating chemotherapy for Hodgkin lymphoma. However, it is suggested to replicate these results in larger studies.\n",
      "PURPOSE: A randomized, double-blind study to compare the gastrointestinal (GI) tolerability, safety and efficacy of etoricoxib and diclofenac in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Patients and Methods: A total of 4,086 patients (mean age 60.8 years) diagnosed with RA were enrolled and received 90 mg of etoricoxib daily (n = 2,032) or 75 mg of diclofenac twice daily ( n = 2,054). The use of gastroprotective agents and low-dose aspirin was permitted. The prespecified primary endpoint was the cumulative rate of patient withdrawals due to clinical and laboratory gastrointestinal adverse events (AEs). Overall safety was also assessed, including data on thrombotic cardiovascular events assessed. Efficacy was assessed using the Patient Global Assessment of Disease Status (PGADS; 0–4 point scale). RESULTS: The mean (SD; maximum) treatment duration was 19.3 (10.3; 32.9) and 19.1 (10.4; 33.1) months in the etoricoxib and diclofenac groups, respectively. The cumulative discontinuation rate due to gastrointestinal AEs was significantly lower with etoricoxib than with diclofenac (5.2 versus 8.5 events per 100 patient years, respectively; relative risk 0.62 (CI 95%: 0.47, 0.81; p < or = 0.001)). The incidence of discontinuations for hypertension- and edema-related AEs was significantly higher with etoricoxib (2.5% and 1.1%, respectively) than with diclofenac (1.5% and 0. 4% respectively; p<0.001 for hypertension and p<0.01 for edema). Treatment with etoricoxib and diclofenac resulted in similar efficacy (mean PGADS changes from baseline -0.62 versus -0.58, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: Etoricoxib 90 mg demonstrated a significantly lower risk of treatment discontinuation due to gastrointestinal AEs compared to diclofenac 150 mg. Discontinuations due to renovascular AEs, although less frequent than discontinuations due to GI AEs, were significantly higher with etoricoxib.\n",
      "INTRODUCTION: The possible anxiogenic effects of fluoroquinolones, namely ciprofloxacin and norfloxacin, were studied in adult Charles Foster albino rats of both sexes, weighing between 150 and 200 g. METHODS: The drugs were administered orally, at doses of 50 mg/kg for five consecutive days and the experiments were carried out on the fifth day. Tests included open-field exploratory behavior, high plus maze and high zero maze, social interaction, and novelty suppressed food latency behavior. RESULTS: Results indicate that rats treated with ciprofloxacin and norfloxacin showed anxiety-like behavior compared to control rats for all parameters studied. However, rats treated with ciprofloxacin and norfloxacin did not differ significantly from each other in various behavioral parameters. CONCLUSION: The present experimental results confirm the clinically observed anxiogenic potential of ciprofloxacin and norfloxacin.\n",
      "BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES: Lipoprotein glomerulopathy (LPG) is a rare disease characterized by thrombus-like substances in markedly dilated glomerular capillaries and elevated plasma levels of apolipoprotein E (apoE). Previous studies have shown that genetic disorders of apoE may contribute to the pathogenesis of LPG, but LPG may not be caused by mutations in the apoE gene in Chinese patients. This study investigated the association of a novel apoE variant with LPG in a Chinese family. METHODS: The apoE gene in a family of 4 LPG patients was sequenced. The polymerase chain reaction product of the apoE exon 4 coding region was cloned into the pMD 18-T vector and then sequenced. RESULTS: A novel point mutation in exon 4 of the apoE gene was identified in all 4 LPG patients and 1 asymptomatic family member. Sequence analysis confirmed a point mutation from nucleotide G to C in exon 4 (base 308) of the apoE gene in all patients and the asymptomatic family member. This missense mutation denotes the amino acid substitution of the proline residue by the arginine residue at position 150 of apoE. These patients were all heterozygous with apoE Guangzhou. One of the two grandsons was a heterozygous carrier of apoE Guangzhou, although he did not suffer from proteinuria. CONCLUSION: The results of this study suggest that apoE (arginine 150 proline) is a new variant of apoE etiologically linked to LPG. This variant (apoE Guangzhou) can cause a marked molecular conformational change in apoE and thus impair its lipid-binding capacity.\n",
      "PURPOSE: Childhood systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) presents a unique subgroup of patients for genetic study. The present study was undertaken to identify susceptibility genes contributing to SLE, using a novel candidate gene pathway microarray platform to study gene expression in patients with SLE since childhood and in their two parents. METHODS: Using bioinformatics tools, a platform of 9,412 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) from 1,204 genes was designed and validated. Molecular inversion probes and high-throughput SNP technologies were used for assay development. Seven hundred and fifty-three subjects, corresponding to 251 complete trios of childhood-onset SLE families, were genotyped and analyzed using transmission disequilibrium testing (TDT) and multitest corrections. RESULTS: Familial TDT showed a significant association of SLE with an N673S polymorphism in the P-selectin gene (SELP) (P = 5.74 x 10(-6)) and a C203S polymorphism in receptor-associated kinase 1 of interleukin-1. gene (IRAK1) (P = 9.58 x 10 (-6)). These 2 SNPs had a false discovery rate for multitest correction <0.05, and therefore a >95% probability of being considered proven. Additionally, 7 additional SNPs had q values ​​<0.5, suggesting an association with SLE and providing direction for follow-up studies. These additional genes notably included TNFRSF6 (Fas) and IRF5, supporting previous findings on their association with SLE pathogenesis. CONCLUSION:SELP and IRAK1 were identified as novel SLE-associated genes with a high degree of importance, suggesting new directions in understanding SLE pathogenesis. The overall design and results of this study demonstrate that the candidate microarray platform used provides a novel and powerful approach that is generally applicable for identifying the genetic underpinnings of complex diseases.\n",
      "BACKGROUND: In addition to blocking nociceptive input to surgical sites, long-acting local anesthetics could directly modulate inflammation. In the present study, we describe the proinflammatory effects of bupivacaine on local prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) production and cyclooxygenase (COX) gene expression that increase postoperative pain in human subjects. METHODS: Subjects (n=114) undergoing extraction of impacted third molars received either 2% lidocaine or 0.5% bupivacaine before surgery and either rofecoxib 50 mg or placebo orally 90 minutes before surgery and for the next 48 hours. Oral mucosal biopsies were taken before surgery and 48 hours after surgery. After extraction, a microdialysis probe was placed at the surgical site for PGE2 and thromboxane B2 (TXB2) measurements. RESULTS: The bupivacaine/rofecoxib group reported significantly less pain, assessed by a visual analog scale, compared to the other three treatment groups during the first 4 hours. However, the bupivacaine/placebo group reported significantly higher pain after 24 hours and PGE2 levels during the first 4 hours were significantly higher than the other three treatment groups. Additionally, bupivacaine significantly increased COX-2 gene expression after 48 hours compared to the lidocaine/placebo group. Thromboxane levels were not significantly affected by any of the treatments, indicating that the observed effects were attributable to inhibition of COX-2, but not COX-1. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that bupivacaine stimulates COX-2 gene expression after tissue injury, which is associated with higher PGE2 production and pain after the local anesthetic effect wears off.\n",
      "OBJECTIVE:The aim of this study was to determine whether mutations in meiotic genes, such as disrupted meiotic cDNA (DMC1), MutS homolog (MSH4), MSH5, and S. cerevisiae homolog (SPO11), were associated with premature ovarian failure (POF). ). DESIGN: Case-control study. METHODS: Blood samples, karyotype, hormonal assay, ultrasound and ovarian biopsy were performed on most patients. However, the primary outcome was genomic DNA sequencing from peripheral blood samples from 41 women with POF and 36 fertile women (controls). RESULTS: A single heterozygous missense mutation, substitution of a cytosine residue for thymidine in exon 2 of MSH5, was found in two Caucasian women in whom POF developed at ages 18 and 36 years . This mutation resulted in the replacement of a non-polar amino acid (proline) with a polar amino acid (serine) at position 29 (P29S). Neither 36 control women nor 39 other POF patients possessed this genetic disruption. Another POF patient of African origin presented a homozygous nucleotide change in the tenth of the DMC1 gene that led to an alteration in the amino acid composition of the protein (M200V). CONCLUSIONS: The infertility symptoms observed in the carrier of the homozygous DMC1 mutation and in the two patients with a heterozygous substitution in exon 2 of the MSH5 gene provide indirect evidence of the role of genes involved in meiotic recombination in the regulation of ovarian function. MSH5 and DMC1 mutations may be an explanation for POF, although rare.\n",
      "Multiple pterygium syndromes (MPS) include a group of multiple birth defects characterized by webbing (pterygia) of the neck, elbows, and/or knees and joint contractures (arthrogryposis). MPS are phenotypically and genetically heterogeneous, but are traditionally divided into lethal and nonfatal prenatal types (Escobar). Previously, we and others reported that recessive mutations in the g subunit of the embryonic acetylcholine receptor (CHRNG) can cause both fatal and nonfatal MPS, demonstrating that pterygia results from fetal akinesia. We hypothesized that mutations in acetylcholine receptor-related genes might also result in an MPS/fetal akinesia phenotype and therefore analyzed 15 cases of fatal MPS/fetal akinesia without CHRNG mutations for mutations in CHRNA1, CHRNB1, CHRND and rapsyn (RAPSN). Genoa. No CHRNA1, CHRNB1, or CHRND mutations were detected, but a homozygous RAPSN frameshift mutation, c.1177-1178delAA, was identified in a family of three children with fatal fetal akinesia sequence. Previously, RAPSN mutations have been reported in congenital myasthenia gravis. Functional studies were consistent with the hypothesis that although incomplete loss of rapsyn function can cause congenital myasthenia gravis, more severe loss of function can result in a lethal fetal akinesia phenotype.\n",
      "BACKGROUND: Afro-Caribbeans in Tobago are at high risk of developing prostate cancer. This elevated risk of prostate cancer is shared by populations of African descent living in various environments across the Western Hemisphere. It was recently reported that variation in the ribonuclease L (RNASEL) gene was associated with increased risk of prostate cancer. However, it is not yet known whether variation in RNASEL contributes to the increased risk of prostate cancer observed in populations of African ancestry. METHODS: We resequenced the positional candidate gene RNASEL in 48 prostate cancer cases and genotyped the previously reported R462Q and D541E polymorphisms in 230 prostate cancer cases and 458 controls. We also examined RNASEL (ABCE1) inhibitor to determine variation associated with prostate cancer risk. RESULTS: We found no evidence of association between R462Q and D541E polymorphisms and prostate cancer risk in our case-control analysis. A new variant (K294E) was identified in a single heterozygous individual with prostate cancer. We also observed a 20 bp insertion/deletion polymorphism, 1109 bp upstream of the start codon, but this variant was not associated with prostate cancer. We identified 16 single-nucleotide polymorphisms in the ABCE1 gene, of which only 3 had a minor allele frequency >5%. A common A/G transition of -1071 bp from the transcription start site was genotyped and showed no evidence of association with prostate cancer. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that common variation in the putative prostate cancer susceptibility gene, RNASEL, or its inhibitor does not contribute significantly to prostate cancer risk in this Afro-Caribbean population.\n",
      "We have previously shown that, in primary sheep pituitary cells, bone morphogenetic protein (BMP)-4 inhibits FSHbeta mRNA expression and FSH release. In contrast, in mouse LbetaT2 gonadotrophs, others showed a stimulatory effect of BMPs on basal or FSHbeta promoter-stimulated transcription. As a species comparison with our previous results, we used LbetaT2 cells to study the effects of BMP-4 on gonadotropin mRNA and modulated activin and GnRH secretion. BMP-4 alone had no effect on FSH production, but enhanced activin + GnRH-induced stimulation of FSHbeta mRNA and FSH secretion, without any effect on FSH mRNA. follistatin. BMP-4 reduced LHbeta mRNA upregulation in response to GnRH (+/-activin) and decreased GnRH receptor expression, which would promote FSH synthesis and secretion , rather than LH. Unlike sheep pituitary gonadotrophs, which only express BMP receptors types IA (BMPRIA) and II (BMPRII), LbetaT2 cells also express BMPRIB. BMP-4-induced Smad1/5 phosphorylation, indicating activation of BMP signaling, was the same whether BMP-4 was used alone or combined with activin+/-GnRH. We hypothesized that activin and/or GnRH pathways might be modulated by BMP-4, but neither activin-stimulated Smad2/3 phosphorylation nor response element-binding phosphorylation ERK1/2 or GnRH-induced cAMP were not altered. However, GnRH-induced p38 MAPK activation was decreased by BMP-4. This was associated with increased FSHbeta mRNA levels and FSH secretion, but decreased LHbeta mRNA levels. These results support 1. BMPs as important modulators of activin- and/or GnRH-stimulated gonadotropin synthesis and release and 2. important species differences in these effects, which could be related to differences in BMP receptor expression in gonadotrophs.\n",
      "Amikacin is an aminoglycoside commonly used to provide empiric double Gram-negative treatment for febrile neutropenia and other suspected infections. Both extended interval and conventional dosing strategies have been widely used in the general medical population; however, data are lacking to support a dosing strategy in the hematology/oncology population. To evaluate amikacin-associated nephrotoxicity in an adult hematology/oncology population, a prospective, randomized, open-label trial was conducted at a university-affiliated medical center. Forty patients with a diagnosis consistent with a hematologic/oncologic disorder requiring aminoglycoside therapy were randomized to receive conventional or extended-interval amikacin. The occurrence of nephrotoxicity through increased serum creatinine and assessment of efficacy via serum concentrations of amikacin with the respective pathogens were assessed. The occurrence of nephrotoxicity was similar between the conventional and extended interval groups, at 10% and 5%, respectively (P = 1.00). Six patients in the conventional group had a positive culture, compared with none in the extended interval group (P = 0.002). The occurrence of nephrotoxicity was similar between the two dosing regimens, but the distribution of risk factors was variable between the two groups. The effectiveness could not be evaluated.\n",
      "BACKGROUND: Fumarate hydratase (HGNC approved gene symbol - FH), also known as fumarase, is an enzyme of the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle, involved in fundamental cellular energy production. First described by Zinn et al. in 1986, FH deficiency led to severe and early encephalopathy. In 2002, the Multiple Leiomyoma Consortium identified heterozygous FH germline mutations in patients with multiple cutaneous and uterine leiomyomas (MCUL: OMIM 150800). In some families, renal cell cancer is also a component of the complex and, as such, has been described as hereditary leiomyomatosis and renal cell cancer (HLRCC: OMIM 605839). The identification of FH as a tumor suppressor was an unexpected finding and, after the identification of succinate dehydrogenase subunits in 2000 and 2001, it was only the second description of the involvement of an intermediary metabolism enzyme in tumorigenesis. DESCRIPTION: The FH Mutation Database is part of the TCA Cycle Gene Mutation Database (formerly the Succinate Dehydrogenase Gene Mutation Database) and is based on the Leiden Open system (source) Variation Database (LOVD). Variants included in the database were derived from published literature and annotated to conform to current mutation nomenclature. The FH database applies the HGVS nomenclature guidelines and will help researchers apply these guidelines when directly submitting new sequence variants online. Since the first molecular characterization of an FH mutation by Bourgeron et al. in 1994, a series of reports in both FH deficiency and MCUL/HLRRC patients described 107 variants, of which 93 were thought to be pathogenic. The most common type of mutation is missense (57%), followed by frameshifts and nonsense (27%) and various deletions, insertions and duplications. Here we introduce an online database detailing all reported FH sequence variants. CONCLUSION:The FH Mutation Database strives to systematically unify all current genetic knowledge about FH variants. We believe that this knowledge will help clinical geneticists and treating physicians in counseling patients and their families, provide a quick and convenient resource for scientific researchers, and may eventually contribute to gaining new knowledge about FH and its associated clinical syndromes.\n",
      "PURPOSE: Mutations in the SOX2 and CHX10 genes have been reported in patients suffering from anophthalmia and/or microphthalmia. In this study, we evaluated 34 DNA samples from anophthalmic/microphthalmic patients (two sibling groups included) for mutations and sequence variants in SOX2 and CHX10. METHODS: Sensitive conformational gel electrophoresis (CSGE) was used for initial screening of SOX2 and CHX10 in 34 affected individuals (two sibling groups), five unaffected family members, and 80 healthy controls. Patient samples containing heteroduplexes were selected for sequence analysis. Base pair changes in SOX2 and CHX10 were confirmed by bidirectional sequencing in patient samples. RESULTS: Two novel heterozygous mutations and two sequence variants (one known) in SOX2 were identified in this cohort. The c.310 G>T (p. Glu104X) mutation, found in one patient, was in the region encoding the high mobility group (HMG) DNA binding domain and resulted in passage of the glutamic acid has a stop codon. The second mutation, noted in two affected siblings, was a single-nucleotide deletion c.549delC (p. Pro184ArgfsX19) in the region encoding the activation domain, resulting in a frameshift and premature termination of the coding sequence. Shortened protein products can cause loss of function. Additionally, a novel nucleotide substitution c.*557G>A was identified in the 3' untranslated region in one patient. The relationship between nucleotide change and protein function is undetermined. A known single nucleotide polymorphism (i.e. *469 C>A, SNP rs11915160) was also detected in 2 of 34 patients. Screening of CHX10 identified two synonymous sequence variants, approximately 471 C>T (p.Ser157Ser, rs35435463) and approximately 579 G>A (p. Gln193Gln, novel SNP), and one non-synonymous sequence variant, approximately 871 G . >A (p. Asp291Asn, SNP novel). Non-synonymous polymorphism was also present in healthy controls, suggesting non-causality. CONCLUSIONS: These results support the role of SOX2 in ocular development. Loss of SOX2 function leads to serious ocular malformations. CHX10 was not involved in microphthalmia/anophthalmia in our patient cohort.\n",
      "PURPOSE: Pituitary adenomas rarely occur during childhood and adolescence. Predisposition to pituitary adenoma (PAP) has recently been associated with germline mutations in the aryl hydrocarbon receptor-interacting protein (AIP) gene. The aim of the study was to examine the proportion of germline AIP mutations in apparently sporadic pediatric pituitary adenomas. DESIGN: Genomic DNA was analyzed for AIP gene mutations, by PCR amplification and direct sequencing. PATIENTS: A population-based cohort, consisting of 36 apparently sporadic pediatric patients with pituitary adenoma, referred to two medical centers in Italy, was included in the study. Patients were younger than 18 years at diagnosis or had clinical signs of adenoma development before age 18. RESULTS: A heterozygous deletion Y248del (c.742_744delTAC) was identified in a patient with GH-secreting adenoma. Loss of heterozygosity (LOH) analysis of tumor DNA revealed loss of the wild-type allele. First-degree relatives carrying the mutation were clinically unaffected. CONCLUSIONS: Although mutations are absent in patients with non-GH-secreting adenomas, germline AIP mutations can be found in children and adolescents with GH-secreting tumors even in the absence family history. The present study reports the results of the analysis of AIP mutations in patients of a single ethnic origin. Clearly, further studies are needed to improve our knowledge of the role of AIP in pediatric pituitary adenomas.\n",
      "BACKGROUND: Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) are involved in the degradation of the extracellular matrix of the intervertebral disc. A SNP for guanine insertion/deletion (G/D), promoter polymorphism -1607, of the MMP1 gene was found to significantly affect promoter activity and corresponding transcription level. It is therefore a good candidate for genetic studies in DDD. METHODS:Southern Chinese volunteers aged 18 to 55 years were recruited from the population. DDD at the lumbar spine was defined by MRI according to the Schneiderman classification. Genomic DNA was isolated from leukocytes and genotyping was performed using the Sequenom platform. Verification of association and Hardy-Weinberg balance was assessed by the Chi-square test and the Mann-Whitney U test. RESULTS:Our results showed substantial evidence of an association between the -1607 promoter polymorphism of MMP1 and DDD in southern Chinese subjects. The D allele was significantly associated with DDD (p-value = 0.027, odds ratio = 1.41 with 95% CI = 1.04-1.90) while the genotypic association on the presence of the D allele was also significantly associated with DDD (p-value = 0.046, odds ratio = 1.04-1.90). 1.50 with 95% CI = 1.01-2.24). Further stratification by age showed a significant genotypic and allelic association in the over 40 group (genotypic: p-value = 0.035, odds ratio = 1.617 with 95% CI = 1.033-2.529; allelic: p-value = 0.033, odds ratio = 1.445 with 95% CI = 1.029-2.029). Disc bulge, annular tears, and Schmorl's nodes were not associated with the D allele. CONCLUSION: We demonstrated that individuals with the presence of the D allele for the -1607 promoter polymorphism of MMP1 are approximately 1.5 times more likely to develop DDD than those with only the G allele. An additional association was identified in individuals over 40 years of age. Disc bulge, annular tear and Schmorl's lymph nodes were not associated with this polymorphism.\n",
      "The present study aimed to investigate the anticonvulsant activity as well as the effects on the level of hippocampal amino acid neurotransmitters (glutamate, aspartate, glycine and GABA) of N-(2-propylpentanoyl)urea (VPU) compared to its parent compound, valproic acid (VPA). VPU was more potent than VPA, exhibiting a median effective dose (ED(50)) of 49 mg/kg to protect rats against pilocarpine-induced seizures, while the corresponding value for VPA was 322 mg/kg. kg. In vivo microdialysis demonstrated that intraperitoneal administration of pilocarpine induced a pronounced increase in hippocampal glutamate and aspartate while no significant changes were observed in glycine and GABA. Pretreatment with VPU (50 and 100 mg/kg) or VPA (300 and 600 mg/kg) completely abolished pilocarpine-evoked increases in extracellular glutamate and aspartate. Additionally, a statistically significant reduction was also observed in the level of GABA and glycine but less than a drastic reduction in the level of glutamate and aspartate. Based on the finding that VPU and VPA could protect animals against pilocarpine-induced seizures, it is suggested that the reduction in inhibitory amino acid neurotransmitters was relatively minor and compensated by a pronounced reduction in glutamate and aspartate. Therefore, like VPA, the finding that VPU could significantly reduce pilocarpine-induced increases in glutamate and aspartate should explain, at least in part, its anticonvulsant activity observed in pilocarpine-induced seizures in animals. laboratory. Certain mechanisms other than those reported here should be the subject of further study.\n",
      "BACKGROUND:Exposure to anthracyclines as part of cancer treatment has been associated with the development of congestive heart failure (CHF). The potential role of genetic risk factors in anthracycline-related CHF remains to be defined. Thus, in this study, the authors examined whether common polymorphisms in candidate genes involved in anthracycline pharmacodynamics (specifically the nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate gene NQO1: quinone oxidoreductase 1 gene and the carbonyl reductase gene 3 CBR3) had an impact on risk. of anthracycline-related CHF. METHODS: A nested case-control study was conducted in a cohort of 1,979 patients enrolled in the Childhood Cancer Survivors Study who received anthracycline therapy and had DNA available. Thirty CHF patients (cases) and 115 matched controls were genotyped for NQO1 (NQO1*2) and CBR3 (substitution of valine [V] of CBR3 for methionine [M] at position 244 [V244M]) polymorphisms. ). Enzyme activity assays with recombinant CBR3 isoforms (CBR3 V244 and CBR3 M244) and the anthracycline substrate doxorubicin were used to study the functional impact of the CBR3 V244M polymorphism. RESULTS: Multivariate analyzes adjusted for sex and primary disease recurrence were used to test associations between candidate genetic polymorphisms (NQO1*2 and CBR3 V244M) and CHF risk. Analyzes indicated no association between the NQO1*2 polymorphism and risk of anthracycline-related CHF (odds ratio [OR], 1.04; P = 0.97). There was a trend toward an association between CBR3 V244M polymorphism and risk of CHF (OR: 8.16; P = 0.056 for G/G vs A/A; OR: 5.44; P = 0.092 for G/ A vs A/UN). Online, recombinant CBR3 V244 (G allele) synthesized 2.6 times more cardiotoxic doxorubicinol per unit time than CBR3 M244 (A allele; CBR3 V244 [8.26+/-3.57 nmol/hour.mg ] vs CBR3 M244 [3.22+/- 0.67 nmol/hour.mg]; 0.01). CONCLUSIONS:The CBR3 V244M functional polymorphism may impact the risk of anthracycline-related CHF in childhood cancer survivors by modulating the intracardiac formation of cardiotoxic anthracycline alcohol metabolites. Larger confirmatory case-control studies are warranted.\n",
      "OBJECTIVE: To report the clinical, ophthalmic and genetic characteristics of corneal lattice dystrophy type I (LCDI) in a Chilean family. METHODS: Six affected family members were examined clinically, including visual acuity, corneal color photography, applanation tonography, and fundoscopy. Genomic DNA was extracted from peripheral leukocytes of six affected and three unaffected members of a family with lattice corneal dystrophy type I. Transforming growth factor-induced gene (TGFBI) exon 4 was screened for the most common mutation, R124C, in the proband. by sequencing. We also designed a rapid polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) method to analyze the same mutation, by amplifying exon 4 and digesting it with the restriction enzyme PstI. Using this strategy, we analyzed the mutation in six affected and three healthy family members. RESULTS: Three generations of family members were positively diagnosed with lattice corneal dystrophy. Six participants exhibited LCD1 in both eyes, most of which were symmetrical. The age of onset of symptoms varied (3 to 42 years). Furthermore, in this family, the age of onset of the disease decreased over the generations, which could be interpreted as anticipation. Visual acuity ranged from 1.0 to 0.13. Two patients, aged 69 and 44, presented with a severity grade of “Poor” based on best-corrected vision and corneal engagement. The proband's TGFBI exon 4 sequence has the heterozygous single-nucleotide mutation, C417T, leading to the amino acid substitution (R124C) in the TGF-induced encoded protein. Using PCR-RFLP, we confirmed the heterozygous mutation in six affected family members and excluded it in three healthy members. CONCLUSIONS: The R124C mutation of TGFBI was found with type I LCD in the studied family. This is the first report of a molecular analysis of type I LCD in Chilean patients. The early onset of affected individuals during the fourth generation raises the possibility of anticipation.\n",
      "Vasoactive intestinal polypeptide (VIP) is an immunomodulatory neuropeptide distributed in the voiding tract. VIP(-/-) mice exhibit impaired bladder function and neurochemical properties in the voiding tract after cyclophosphamide (CYP)-induced cystitis. Given the role of VIP as an anti-inflammatory mediator, we hypothesized that VIP(-/-) mice would exhibit increased expression of the inflammatory mediator after cystitis. An array of mouse inflammatory cytokine and RT2 receptor profilers was used to determine regulated transcripts in the bladder of wild-type (WT) and VIP (-/-) mice with or without CYP-induced cystitis (150 mg /kg i.p.; Four binary comparisons were performed: WT control versus CYP treatment (48 h), VIP(-/-) control versus CYP treatment (48 h), WT control versus VIP(-/-) control, and WT with CYP treatment (48 h ). ) versus VIP(-/-) with CYP treatment (48 h). The genes shown represent (1) a greater than 1.5-fold change in either direction and (2) the p-value is less than 0.05 for the comparison performed. Several regulated genes were validated using enzyme-linked immunoassays, including IL-1beta and CXCL1. CYP treatment significantly (p < or = 0.001) increased the expression of CXCL1 and IL-1beta in the bladder of WT and VIP (-/-) mice, but increased the expression in VIP (-/-) mice. -/-) treated with CYP was significantly (p < or = 0.001) higher (4.2- to 13-fold increase) than that observed in WT bladder (3.6- to 5-fold increase). Data suggest that in VIP(-/-) mice with bladder inflammation, inflammatory mediators are higher than those observed in WT mice with CYP. This shift in balance may contribute to increased bladder dysfunction in VIP(-/-) mice with bladder inflammation and altered neurochemical expression in the voiding tract.\n",
      "TAC has been shown to be a potent immunosuppressive agent for pediatric solid organ transplantation. Neurotoxicity is a potentially serious toxic effect. It is characterized by encephalopathy, headaches, seizures or neurological deficits. Here we describe an eight and a half year old male kidney transplant recipient with right BN. MRI demonstrated hyperintense T2 signals in the cervical cord and roots of the right brachial plexus, indicating both myelitis and right brachial plexitis. Symptoms persisted for three months despite TAC dose reduction, IVIG administration, and four doses of methylprednisolone pulse therapy. Improvement and ultimately complete recovery occurred only after complete cessation of TAC and successful replacement with everolimus.\n",
      "INTRODUCTION: Somatic alterations have been shown to correlate with breast cancer prognosis and survival, but less is known about the effects of common inherited genetic variations. Of particular interest are genes involved in cell cycle pathways, which regulate cell division. METHODS: We examined associations between common germline genetic variations in 13 genes involved in cell cycle control (CCND1, CCND2, CCND3, CCNE1, CDK2[p33], CDK4, CDK6, CDKN1A[p21, Cip1], CDKN1B[ p27, Kip1], CDKN2A[p16], CDKN2B[p15], CDKN2C[p18], and CDKN2D[p19]) and survival in women diagnosed with invasive breast cancer participating in the SEARCH Breast Cancer Study ( Studies of Epidemiology and Risk Factors in Cancer Heredity). The DNA of 4,470 women was genotyped for 85 polymorphisms that mark known common polymorphisms (minor allele frequency >0.05) in genes. Genotypes of each polymorphism were tested for their association with survival using Cox regression analysis. RESULTS: The rare allele of the single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) rs2479717 is associated with an increased risk of death (hazard ratio = 1.26 per carried rare allele, 95% confidence interval: 1.12 to 1.42; P = 0.0001), which was not the case. attenuated after adjustment for tumor stage, grade and treatment. This SNP is part of a large linkage disequilibrium block, which contains CCND3, BYSL, TRFP, USP49, C6ofr49, FRS3, and PGC. We assessed the association between survival and somatic expression of these genes in breast tumors using expression microarray data from seven published datasets. High expression of the C6orf49 transcript was associated with breast cancer survival, adding biological relevance to the finding. CONCLUSION: It is possible that CCND3 rs2479717, or another variant it labels, is associated with prognosis after a breast cancer diagnosis. Further study is needed to validate this finding.\n",
      "We studied the effects of antithrombin, a plasma inhibitor of clotting factors, in rats with puromycin aminonucleoside-induced nephrosis, which is an experimental model of human nephrotic syndrome. Antithrombin (50 or 500 IU/kg/iv) was administered to rats once daily for 10 days immediately after injection of puromycin aminonucleoside (50 mg/kg/iv). Antithrombin treatment attenuated puromycin aminonucleoside-induced hematologic abnormalities. Renal dysfunction and hyperlipidemia induced by puromycin aminonucleoside were also suppressed. Histopathological examination revealed severe renal lesions such as protein casts in the tubuli and tubular expansion in the kidneys of control rats, while improvement of lesions was observed in antithrombin-treated rats. Furthermore, antithrombin treatment markedly suppressed the aminonucleoside puromycin-induced apoptosis of renal tubular epithelial cells. In addition, puromycin aminonucleoside-induced increases in renal cytokine content were also decreased. These results suggest that thrombin plays an important role in the pathogenesis of puromycin aminonucleoside-induced nephrotic syndrome. Antithrombin therapy may be clinically effective in patients with nephrotic syndrome.\n",
      "BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Despite the benefits of induction and maintenance of sevoflurane anesthesia, postoperative nausea and vomiting frequently occur. Fentanyl is a commonly used supplement that may contribute to this, although it may also improve analgesia. METHODS: This double-blind study examined the incidence and severity of postoperative nausea, vomiting, and pain during the first 24 hours after sevoflurane anesthesia in 216 adult day surgery patients. Patients were randomly assigned to receive 1 1 of fentanyl or not, while a third group received dexamethasone in addition to fentanyl. RESULTS: Omission of fentanyl did not reduce the overall incidence of postoperative nausea and vomiting, but reduced the incidence of moderate to severe vomiting and/or nausea before discharge by 20% and 17% with fentanyl and fentanyl-dexamethasone, respectively, at 5% (P = 0.013). Antiemetic requirements were reduced from 24% and 31% to 7% (P = 0.0012). Dexamethasone had no significant effect on the incidence or severity of postoperative nausea and vomiting. Combining the two fentanyl groups revealed additional significant benefits related to opioid avoidance, reducing postoperative nausea and vomiting and predischarge nausea from 35% and 33% to 22% and 19% (P = 0.049 and P = 0.035), respectively, while nausea in the first 24 hours decreased from 42% to 27% (P = 0.034). Pain intensity and analgesic requirements were not affected by omission of fentanyl. Fentanyl effectively reduced minor intraoperative movements, but had no sparing effect on sevoflurane and increased respiratory depression, hypotension, and bradycardia. CONCLUSION: Because fentanyl exacerbated postoperative nausea and vomiting without improvement in postoperative pain and also had adverse cardiorespiratory effects, it appears to be an unnecessary and potentially harmful adjunct to sevoflurane in day surgery.\n",
      "Curcumin is the active component of turmeric, and this polyphenolic compound has been widely studied as an anticancer drug that modulates multiple pathways and genes. In this study, 10 to 25 micromoles/L of curcumin inhibited the growth of 253JB-V and KU7 bladder cancer cells, which was accompanied by induction of apoptosis and a decrease in expression of the pro-apoptotic protein survivin and the angiogenic proteins vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and VEGF receptor 1 (VEGFR1). Since the expression of survivin, VEGF, and VEGFR1 depends on specificity protein (Sp) transcription factors, we also investigated the effects of curcumin on Sp protein expression as a mechanism underlying the apoptotic and antiangiogenic activity of this compound. The results show that curcumin induced proteasome-dependent downregulation of Sp1, Sp3, and Sp4 in 253JB-V and KU7 cells. Furthermore, using RNA interference with small RNA inhibitors of Sp1, Sp3, and Sp4, we observed that curcumin-dependent inhibition of nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB)-dependent genes, such as bcl-2, survivin, and cyclin D1, was also due, in part, to loss of Sp proteins. Curcumin also decreased the growth of bladder tumors in cell-bearing athymic nude mice KU7 in the form of xenografts, which was accompanied by a decrease in the levels of Sp1, Sp3 and Sp4 proteins in the tumors. These results show for the first time that one of the underlying mechanisms of action of curcumin as an anticancer chemotherapeutic agent is due, in part, to a decrease in the expression of Sp transcription factors in cells. bladder cancers.\n",
      "The penicillin model is a widely used experimental model for epilepsy research. In the present study, we aimed to present a detailed spectral analysis of penicillin-induced epileptiform activity relative to basal brain activity in anesthetized Wistar rats. Male Wistar rats were anesthetized i.p. urethane and connected to an electrocorticogram setup. After a short period of recording basal activity, a seizure focus was induced by injecting 400 IU/2 μl of potassium penicillin-G into the left lateral ventricle while cortical activity was recorded continuously. Basal activity, latency period, and periods of penicillin-induced epileptiform activity were then analyzed using conventional methods and spectral analysis. Spectral analyzes were performed by dividing the entire spectrum into different frequency bands, including delta, theta (slow and fast), alpha-sigma, beta (1 and 2), and gamma (1 and 2). Our results show that the most affected frequency bands were the delta, theta, beta-2 and gamma-2 bands during epileptiform activity and that there were marked differences in spectral densities between the three episodes studied ( basal activity, latency period and epileptiform activity). . Our results can help analyze new data obtained using similar experimental models and the simple analysis method described here can be used in similar studies to investigate the basic neuronal mechanism of this type of experimental epilepsy or d other types of experimental epilepsy.\n",
      "Recent studies have reported germline mutations in the GATA4 gene in certain types of congenital heart disease (CHD). However, the prevalence of GATA4 mutations in coronary heart disease and the correlation between GATA4 genotype and CHD phenotype have not been studied extensively. We screened germline mutations in the coding exons and flanking intron sequences of the GATA4 gene in 486 patients with CAD by denaturing high-performance liquid chromatography (DHPLC), and confirmed the mutations by sequencing. Nine distinct mutations, including one small deletion mutation (46delS), two small insertion mutations (118-119insA and 125-126insAA), and six non-synonymous mutations (A6V, P163S, E359K, P407Q, S429T, and A442V) were identified in 12 of 486 patients (nine with ventricular septal defect, two with Tetralogy of Fallot, and one with endocardial cushion defect). Among them, two patients carrying the E359K mutation belonged to two generations of the same family presenting a ventricular septal defect (VSD). Interestingly, a nucleotide insertion of approximately 1146+25insA in exon 6 was detected in five VSD patients, but not in 486 healthy normal controls. Our results are useful for understanding the prevalence of GATA4 mutations and the correlation between GATA4 genotype and CHD phenotype in Chinese patients.\n",
      "Often, chemotherapy with doxorubicin (Adriamycin) is limited due to potentially life-threatening cardiotoxicity in patients during and after treatment. Recently, we showed that moderate dietary restriction remarkably protects against doxorubicin-induced cardiotoxicity. This cardioprotection is accompanied by a reduction in cardiac oxidative stress and triglycerides, as well as an increase in cardiac fatty acid oxidation, ATP synthesis and positive regulation of the JAK/STAT3 pathway. . In the present study, we examined whether a physiological intervention of administering a 40% high-fat diet (HFD), which induces obesity in male Sprague-Dawley rats (250–275 g), sensitizes cardiotoxicity induced by doxorubicin. An LD(10) dose (8 mg doxorubicin/kg, ip) administered on day 43 of the HFD diet resulted in higher cardiotoxicity, cardiac dysfunction, lipid peroxidation, and 80% mortality in obese rats (OB ) in the absence of any significant renal or hepatic toxicity. Toxicokinetic studies of doxorubicin revealed no changes in the accumulation of doxorubicin and doxorubicinol (toxic metabolite) in normal diet (ND) and OB fed hearts. Mechanistic studies revealed that OB rats are sensitized due to: (1) higher oxyradical stress leading to upregulation of uncoupling proteins 2 and 3, (2) downregulation of cardiac peroxisome proliferators activated by alpha receptor, (3) a decrease in plasma levels of adiponectin, (4) decrease in cardiac oxidation of fatty acids (666.9 +/- 14.0 nmol/min/g of heart in ND versus 400, 2 +/- 11.8 nmol/min/g heart in OB), (5) decrease in mitochondrial AMP-alpha2 protein kinase and (6) 86% decrease in cardiac ATP levels accompanied by a decrease in ATP/ADP ratio after doxorubicin administration. Decreased cardiac erythropoietin and increased SOCS3 further downregulated the cardioprotective JAK/STAT3 pathway. In conclusion, HFD-induced obese rats are highly sensitized to doxorubicin-induced cardiotoxicity by significantly downregulating cardiac mitochondrial ATP generation, increasing oxidative stress, and downregulating the JAK/STAT3 pathway.\n",
      "OBJECTIVE: To describe the clinical and genetic characteristics of a Thai family with non-autoimmune hyperthyroidism (NAH) caused by an activating germline mutation in the thyrotropin receptor (TSHR) gene. PATIENTS: Three affected individuals belonging to the same family (a father and his two children) were studied. Clinical and imaging findings were reviewed and compared. GENETIC ANALYSIS: Genomic DNA was extracted from peripheral blood leukocytes and mutation analysis of the entire coding sequence of the TSHR gene was performed in children and their parents by direct DNA sequencing. RESULTS: A heterozygous T to C germline transition in exon 10 of the TSHR gene (c.1358T-->C) resulting in the substitution of methionine (ATG) by threonine (ACG) at codon 453 (p.M453T) a was identified in the father and his two children. They presented different clinical severity and variable age of onset. In addition to hyperthyroidism, ventriculomegaly and bilateral shortening of the fifth metacarpal bone and middle phalanges of the fifth finger were consistently observed in all affected individuals. CONCLUSIONS:Ventriculomegaly and bilateral shortening of the bones of the fifth metacarpal and middle phalanges of the fifth finger may be characteristic features of NAH due to an activating germline mutation in TSHR. Furthermore, shortening of the middle phalanges of the fifth finger has never been described before, thus broadening the phenotypic spectrum of the disease.\n",
      "There are currently no known genetic diseases linked to prolactin (Prl) or its receptor (PrlR) in humans. Given the essential role of this hormonal system in breast physiology, we considered that genetic abnormalities of the Prl/PrlR genes could be linked to the occurrence of breast diseases with high proliferative potential. Multiple fibroadenomas (MFA) are benign breast tumors that appear most frequently in young women, including at puberty, when Prl has well-known proliferative actions on the breast. In a prospective study involving 74 MFA patients and 170 control subjects, we identified four patients with a heterozygous single nucleotide polymorphism in exon 6 of the PrlR gene, encoding the Ile(146)->Leu substitution in its extracellular domain. This single substitution was sufficient to confer constitutive activity to the receptor variant (PrlR(I146L)), as assessed in three reconstituted cell models (Ba/F3, HEK293, and MCF-7 cells) by PrlR tyrosine phosphorylation(i ) independent of Prl, (ii) activation of signal transducer and activator of signaling transcription 5 (STAT5), (iii) activity transcriptional to a Prl-responsive reporter gene, and (iv) cell proliferation and protection against cell death. Constitutive PrlR(I146L) activity in a patient's breast sample was supported by increased STAT5 signaling. This is a unique description of a functional PrlR mutation associated with human disease. The constitutive activity features were all reversed by a specific PrlR antagonist, opening potential therapeutic approaches for MFA or any other diseases that may be associated with this mutation in the future.\n",
      "The mechanism of isoproterenol-induced myocardial damage is unknown, but a mismatch between oxygen supply and demand following coronary hypotension and myocardial hyperactivity is the best explanation for the complex morphological alterations observed. Severe alterations in the structural integrity of the cardiomyocyte sarcolemma have been shown to be caused by isoproterenol. Taking into account that the integrity of the sarcolemma is stabilized by the dystrophin-glycoprotein complex (DGC) which connects actin and laminin in the contractile machinery and the extracellular matrix and by integrins, this study tests the hypothesis according to which isoproterenol affects sarcolemma stability through changes in DGC and integrins. . We found different sensitivity of DGC and integrin to subcutaneous administration of isoproterenol. Immunofluorescent staining revealed that dystrophin is the most sensitive among the actin-connecting structures in the cardiomyocyte cytoskeleton and extracellular matrix. Dissolution of sarcomeric actin occurred after reduction or loss of dystrophin. Subsequently, after myofilament lysis, the expressions of gamma-sarcoglycan, beta-dystroglycan, beta1-integrin, and laminin alpha-2 were reduced, followed by their degradation, as epiphenomena of the process. myocytolytic. In conclusion, administration of isoproterenol to rats results in a primary loss of dystrophin, the most sensitive among the structural proteins that form the DGC that connects the extracellular matrix and the cytoskeleton of cardiomyocytes. These modifications, linked to an ischemic lesion, explain the severe alterations in the structural integrity of the sarcolemma of cardiomyocytes and therefore the serious and irreversible lesions induced by isoproterenol.\n",
      "This study was conducted to determine the prevalence of alkaptonuria in the UAE population and to identify the genotype of affected individuals. Through a three-stage sampling technique, 2,981 students from public schools in Al Ain and private schools in Dubai were selected to participate in the study, of which 2,857 provided urine samples . The collected urine was analyzed for the presence of homogentisic acid by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. Genomic DNA was isolated from white blood cells of all family members of the affected case according to established standard protocols. Specific PRC primers were designed to amplify all 14 exons of the HGD gene with flanking intronic sequences, including splice site sequences. 2,857 children returned a viable urine sample, one of which was highly positive for homogentisic acid. All 12 members of this girl's family were studied and one of them, a 22-year-old brother, was excreting HGA. Another, a sister who had not provided a urine sample, was discovered through genetic testing. No member of this family complained of joint pain or other symptoms. The parents were first cousins. We found a single nucleotide deletion c.342delA, located in exon 3, which resulted in a frameshift at amino acid position 58 (p.Arg58fs or p.R58fs). Alkaptonuria may be more common than previously thought, with an estimated allelic prevalence of 0.0107 (95% CI 0.000392-0.03473). The R58fs mutation is ancient, perhaps appearing several thousand years ago, and has spread over a wide geographic area.\n",
      "Diffuse mesangial sclerosis presents as an isolated abnormality or as part of a syndrome. Recently, mutations in phospholipase C epsilon 1 (PLCE1) were found to cause a nonsyndromic autosomal recessive form of this disease. Here we describe three children from the same consanguineous family of Pakistani origin suffering from diffuse mesangial sclerosis who presented with congenital or infantile nephrotic syndrome. Homozygous mutations in PLCE1 (also known as KIAA1516, PLCE or NPHS3) were identified following genome-wide mapping of single nucleotide polymorphisms. All affected children were homozygous for a four base pair deletion in exon 3, which created a premature translation stop codon. Analysis of the asymptomatic father of two of the children revealed that he was also homozygous for the same mutation. We conclude that this non-penetrance may be due to compensatory mutations at a second locus and that mutation within PLCE1 is not always sufficient to cause diffuse mesangial sclerosis.\n",
      "Serous ovarian carcinoma (OSC) is the most common and deadly histologic type of ovarian epithelial malignancy. Mutations of TP53 and dysfunction of the tumor suppressor proteins Brca1 and/or Brca2 have been implicated in the molecular pathogenesis of a large fraction of OSCs, but frequent somatic mutations in other well-established tumor suppressor genes have not been implicated in the molecular pathogenesis of a large fraction of OSCs. not been identified. Using a genome-wide examination of DNA copy number alterations in 36 primary OSCs, we identified two tumors with apparent homozygous deletions of the NF1 gene. Subsequently, 18 ovarian carcinoma-derived cell lines and 41 primary OSCs were evaluated for NF1 alterations. Markedly reduced or absent expression of Nf1 protein was observed in 6 of 18 cell lines, and using the protein truncation assay and sequencing of cDNA and genomic DNA, mutations in NF1 resulted in deletion of exons and/or aberrant splicing of NF1 transcripts were detected in 5 of 6 cell lines with loss of NF1 expression. Similarly, NF1 alterations, including homozygous deletions and splicing mutations, were identified in 9 (22%) of 41 primary OSCs. As expected, tumors and cell lines with NF1 defects lacked mutations in KRAS or BRAF but showed activation of the Ras pathway based on immunohistochemical detection of phosphorylated MAPK (primary tumors) or increased levels of GTP-bound Ras (cell lines). The tumor suppressor gene TP53 was mutated in all OSCs with a documented NF1 mutation, suggesting that pathways regulated by these two tumor suppressor proteins often cooperate in the development of ovarian carcinomas with serous differentiation.\n",
      "OBJECTIVE: The aim of the study was to evaluate polymorphisms of the renin-angiotensin system and the serotonin transporter gene in relation to hemodynamic parameters and heart rate variability during a head-up tilt test (HUT) in patients with vasovagal syncope. METHODS: DNA was collected from 191 patients (mean age 44+/-18 years, 61 men, 130 women). The following genetic polymorphisms were determined in genomic DNA: angiotensin converting enzyme (I/D ACE) insertion/deletion polymorphism, angiotensinogen gene (M 235) polymorphism, angiotensin II type 1 receptor (ATR1) (A 11666C) and serotonin transporter gene polymorphism (5HTTLPR). Heart rate variability during HUT was assessed at 5-min intervals by low frequency, high frequency, standard deviation of normal to normal (SDNN), and root mean square successive difference parameters. RESULTS: The AA genotype of the A 1166C polymorphism was associated with lower minimum systolic blood pressure (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) during HUT compared to other genotypes (minimum SBP: AA 59.6+/- 21.8, AC 79.9+/- AA genotype was also associated with higher SDNN compared to other genotypes in the early phase of HUT (SDNN in 5 minutes of inclination: AA 59.7+/-24.6, AC 50.6+/-20.6, CC 46.0+/-13.2, P=0.01) and at syncope occurrence (SDNN: AA 71.0+/-20.9, AC 58.2+/-17.9, CC 58+/-10, P=0.04) CONCLUSION: AA genotype of A 1166C polymorphism in ATR1 gene may be associated with hypotension and decline of sympathetic tone during HUT. Its role in genetic predisposition to vasovagal syncope cannot be excluded.\n",
      "In the present study, we explored the effect of three TS gene polymorphisms on the overall and progression-free survival of colorectal cancer (CRC) patients undergoing 5FU chemotherapy. A 28 bp variable number of tandem repeats (VNTR), a G/C single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) and a 6 bp deletion at position 1494 were studied. The possible combined effect of these DNA polymorphisms on patients' clinical outcomes was also evaluated. A retrospective study was performed on paraffin-embedded sections of 113 patients diagnosed with advanced CRC. The TS genotyping methods were polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for VNTR and PCR, followed by restriction length fragment polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) for SNP and ins/del 6 bp. To study the combined effect of TS polymorphisms, four categories were defined based on the expression level assigned to the SNP and ins/del 6 bp genotypes: C_allele 6-, C_6+/6+, G_allele6- and G_6+/6+. VNTR and ins/del 6 bp genotypes varied by tumor anatomical site: 2R/2R genotype was rare in left-sided tumors (7.0% vs. 26.3% of right-sided cancers and 24.1 % of rectal cancers; P < 0.01), where the 6- allele variant was very common (69.0%). Instead, most patients with right-sided tumors were 6+/6+ wild-type homozygotes (63.9%) (P < 0.01). The heterozygous 6+/6- genotype was more common among tumors classified as Dukes stages C (50.0%) and D (76.5%) (P = 0.05). None of the studied polymorphisms alone affected overall or progression-free survival (PFS). The combined genotypes C_6+/6+ and G_6+/6+ were respectively associated with the best and worst PFS (P=0.03 compared to each other), while the combinations carrying the 6- allele determined an evolution intermediate which could be indicative of a variable response. to chemotherapy. The rate of Dukes stage B tumors was surprisingly high (59.1%) among patients with the unfavorable G_6+/6+ combination. In our study, the combination of G_6+/6+ genotypes with high TS expression identifies a high-risk group in CRC patients treated with 5FU.\n",
      "BACKGROUND:Oculopharyngeal muscular dystrophy (OPMD) is a late-onset autosomal dominant muscular disorder. OPMD is caused by a short trinucleotide repeat expansion encoding an enlarged polyalanine tract in the polyadenylate binding protein nuclear 1 (PABPN1) gene. We identified and characterized a PABPN1 mutation in a Taiwanese family with OPMD. METHODS:The phenotypic and genotypic characteristics of all subjects were evaluated in a Taiwanese OPMD family. Genetic alterations in the PABPN1 gene were identified by PCR and DNA sequencing. RESULTS: Ten subjects with OPMD (6 symptomatic and 4 asymptomatic) in the Taiwanese family carried a novel mutation in the PABPN1 gene. The normal sequence (GCG)6(GCA)3GCG was replaced by (GCG)6(GCA)(GCG)4(GCA)3GCG due to an insertion of (GCG)4GCA in the normal allele in Taiwanese subjects OPMD. CONCLUSIONS: Unlike a single GCG expansion in most OPMD patients in the literature, an insertion of (GCG)4GCA in the PABPN1 gene was found in Taiwanese OPMD subjects. The identification of this mutation appears to support the molecular mechanism of unequal crossover of two PABPN1 alleles.\n",
      "1. Optical isomers of propranolol were compared for their beta-blocking and antiarrhythmic activities.2. By blocking positive inotropic and chronotropic responses to isoprenaline, (+)-propranolol had less than one-hundredth the potency of (-)-propranolol. At doses of (+)-propranolol that attenuated responses to isoprenaline, there was a significant prolongation of the ECG PR interval.3. The metabolic responses to isoprenaline in dogs (increases in circulating glucose, lactate and free fatty acids) were all blocked by (-)-propranolol. (+)-propranolol had no effect on fatty acid mobilization but significantly reduced increases in lactate and glucose.4. The two isomers of propranolol had similar depressant potency on isolated auricular muscle taken from guinea pigs.5. Propranolol isomers exhibited similar local anesthetic potencies on an isolated frog nerve preparation at a level approximately three times that of procaine. The racemic compound was significantly less potent than either isomer.6. Both isomers of propranolol were able to prevent adrenaline-induced cardiac arrhythmias in halothane-anesthetized cats, but the mean dose of (-)-propranolol was 0.09+/-0.02 mg/kg while that of (+)-propranolol was 4.2+/-1.2mg/kg. At the effective dose of (+)-propranolol, there was a significant prolongation of the ECG PR interval. Blocking arrhythmias with both isomers was surmountable by increasing the dose of adrenaline.7. Both propranolol isomers were also able to reverse ouabain-induced ventricular tachycardia in anesthetized cats and dogs. The dose of (-)-propranolol was significantly lower than that of (+)-propranolol in both species, but well above that required to produce evidence of beta-blockade.8. The implications of these results are discussed.\n",
      "The chromosomal region 12q24 has previously been implicated in linkage studies of bipolar disorder and unipolar mood disorder and we have reported two pedigrees separating both bipolar disorder and Darier disease that show a link in this region. The P2RX7 gene is located in this chromosomal region and has recently been reported as a susceptibility gene for bipolar disorder and unipolar depression. The non-synonymous SNP rs2230912 (resulting in the Q460R amino acid polymorphism) showed the strongest association and was postulated to be pathogenically relevant. We studied this gene in a large case-control sample in the United Kingdom (bipolar I disorder N = 687, unipolar recurrent major depression N = 1,036, controls N = 1,204). Neither rs2230912 nor any of the other 8 SNPs genotyped in P2RX7 were associated with mood disorders in general, nor specifically with bipolar or unipolar disorders. Furthermore, sequencing of our two bipolar-Darier families linked to chromosome 12 showed no evidence of rare variants at P2RX7 that could explain the linkage. Our data do not support rs2230912 or other studied polymorphisms within the P2RX7 locus being involved in susceptibility to mood disorders.\n",
      "OBJECTIVES:Several SNPs and a microsatellite polymorphism of the cytosine-adenine repeat promoter of the IGF-1 gene have been reported to be associated with circulating serum IGF-1 concentrations. Variation in IGF-1 concentrations due to genetic variations may affect different responses to growth hormone (GH) treatment, resulting in different GH doses required individually in GH-deficient patients. The aim of this study was to test whether IGF-1 gene polymorphisms are associated with GH dose of GH-deficient adults. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of nine marking SNPs, five additional selected SNPs and one cytosine-adenine repeat polymorphism were determined in 133 German adult patients (66 men, 67 women; mean age 45.4 years +/- 13, 1 standard deviation; majority Caucasian). with GH deficiency (GHD) of different origin, derived from the prospective pharmacogenetic study Pfizer International Metabolic Study (KIMS). Patients received GH treatment for 12 months with completed GH dose titration and centralized IGF-1 measurements. GH dose after 1 year of treatment, IGF-1 concentrations, IGF-1 standard deviation score (SDS), IGF-1:GH ratio, and anthropometric data were analyzed by genotype. RESULTS: With the exception of rs1019731, which showed a significant difference in IGF-1-SDS across genotypes (p = 0.02), all polymorphisms showed no association with GH doses, concentrations of IGF-1, IGF-1-SDS and IGF-1. :GH ratio after adjustment for the confounding variables sex, age and BMI. CONCLUSION: IGF-1 gene polymorphisms were not associated with responsiveness to exogenous GH in GHD. Therefore, genetic variations in the IGF-1 gene do not appear to be major influencing factors on the GH-IGF axis causing a variable response to exogenous GH treatment.\n",
      "Osteogenesis imperfecta (OI) is an inherited bone disease characterized by fractures with minimal trauma. Intracranial hemorrhages have been reported in a small number of patients with OI. Here we describe three patients, a boy (aged 15 years) and two girls (aged 17 and 7 years) with type III OI who suffered from intracranial hemorrhage and who additionally presented with brachydactyly and hypoplasia nails. In all of these patients, OI was caused by glycine mutations affecting exon 49 of the COL1A2 gene, which encodes the most carboxy-terminal portion of the triple helix domain of the alpha 2 chain of type I collagen. These observations suggest that mutations in this region of the alpha 2 chain of type I collagen carry a high risk of abnormal limb development and intracranial hemorrhage.\n",
      "A prospective, randomized, double-blind pilot study to compare the outcomes of stereotactic unilateral pallidotomy and subthalamotomy in advanced idiopathic Parkinson's disease (PD) refractory to medical treatment was designed. Ten consecutive patients (mean age, 58.4 +/- 6.8 years; 7 men, 3 women) with similar characteristics for disease duration (mean disease duration, 8.4 +/- 3.5 years), invalidating motor fluctuations (Hoehn _ Yahr stage 3 -5 in non-drug phases) and levodopa-induced dyskinesias were selected. All patients had bilateral symptoms and their levodopa equivalent dose was analyzed. Six patients were operated on in the internal globus pallidus (GPi) and four in the subthalamic nucleus (STN). Clinical assessment included use of the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS), Hoehn_Yahr score, and Schwab England Activities of Daily Living (ADL) score in “with” and “without” medication before surgery and 6 months after surgery. There was a statistically significant improvement in all major contralateral Parkinsonian motor signs in all patients followed for 6 months. The equivalent daily dose of levodopa was significantly reduced in the STN group. Changes in UPDRS, Hoehn_Yahr, and Schwab England ADL scores were similar in both groups. Cognitive functions were unchanged in both groups. Complications were observed in two patients: one had left homonymous hemianopia after pallidotomy and another developed left hemiballistic movements 3 days after subthalamotomy that partially improved within 1 month with Valproate 1000 mg/day. The results of this study suggest that lesions of the unilateral STN and GPi are an equally effective treatment for patients with advanced PD refractory to medical treatment.\n",
      "Unlike disorders of sexual differentiation caused by a lack of androgen production or inhibition of androgen action, defects affecting the development of bipotent genital anlagen have rarely been studied in humans. We have previously documented that the transcription factor FOXF2 is highly expressed in the human foreskin. Additionally, Foxf2 knockout mice exhibit cleft palate associated with genital tubercle hypoplasia. We hypothesized that humans with disorders of sexual development (DSD) associated with cleft palate may have mutations in the FOXF2 gene. Eighteen children with DSD and cleft palate were identified in L beck's DSD database (approximately 1,500 entries). Genomic DNA sequence analysis of the FOXF2 gene was performed and compared to 10 normal female controls and 10 normal male controls, respectively. Two heterozygous DNA sequence variations were present in only one patient each but in none of the 20 normal controls: a duplication of GCC (c.97GCC[9]+[10]) resulting in an additional alanine in the exon 1 and a 25* G>A substitution in the 3' untranslated region. Two patients had a sequence variation of approximately 262G>A predicting an Ala88Thr exchange that was also detected in 2 normal controls. Two silent mutations, respectively c.1272C>T (Ser424Ser) and c.1284T>C (Tyr428Tyr), occurred in the coding region of exon 2, again in patients and normal controls. In conclusion, the majority of sequence alterations detected were polymorphisms with no obvious functional relevance. However, it cannot be excluded that the 2 unique DNA sequence alterations may have affected FOXF2 at the mRNA or protein level, thereby contributing to the observed disruptions in genital and palatal development.\n",
      "Malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors (MPNST) are the most common malignancy associated with neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1). These Schwann cell lineage-derived sarcomas aggressively invade adjacent nerves and soft tissues, frequently preventing surgical resection. Little is known about the mechanisms underlying this invasive behavior. We showed that MPNSTs express beta isoforms of neuregulin-1 (NRG-1), which promote Schwann cell migration during development, and alpha isoforms of NRG-1, which have effects on Schwann cells. Schwann are poorly understood. Assuming that NRG-1 beta and/or NRG-1 alpha promote MPNST invasion, we found that NRG-1 beta promoted MPNST migration in a substrate-specific manner, markedly enhancing migration on laminin but not on type I collagen or fibronectin. NRG-1 receptors erbB3 and erbB4 were present in MPNST (Invasion Mediating Processes) invadopodia, partially colocalized with focal adhesion kinase and laminin receptor beta(1)-integrin and coimmunoprecipitated with beta(1) ) -integrin. NRG-1 beta stimulated the migration and invasion of human and murine MPNST cells in a concentration-dependent manner in three-dimensional migration assays, acting as a chemotactic factor. Baseline- and NRG-1 beta-induced migration was erbB dependent and required the action of MEK 1/2, SAPK/JNK, PI-3 kinase, Src family kinases, and ROCK-I /II. In contrast, NRG-1 alpha had no effect on the migration and invasion of some MPNST lineages and inhibited the migration of others. While NRG-1 beta potently and persistently activated Erk 1/2, SAPK/JNK, Akt, and Src family kinases, NRG-1 alpha did not activate Akt and activated these other kinases with kinetics distinct from those evident. in beta-stimulated NRG-1. cells. These results suggest that NRG-1 beta enhances MPNST migration and that NRG-1 beta and NRG-1 alpha differentially modulate this process.\n",
      "Warfarin-associated intracerebral hemorrhage (W-ICH) is a serious type of stroke. There is no consensus on the optimal treatment of W-ICH. Using a mouse model, we tested whether rapid reversal of anticoagulation using human prothrombin complex concentrate (PCC) could reduce hemorrhagic blood volume. Male CD-1 mice were treated with warfarin (2 mg/kg over 24 h), resulting in a mean (+/-SD) international normalized ratio of 3.5 +/- 0.9 . First, we showed that intravenous administration of human PCC rapidly reversed anticoagulation in mice. Second, a stereotaxic injection of collagenase was administered to induce hemorrhage in the right striatum. Forty-five minutes later, animals were randomly treated with PCC (100 U/kg) or i.v. saline (n=12 per group). Twenty-four hours after induction of hemorrhage, hemorrhagic blood volume was quantified using a photometric hemoglobin test. Mean hemorrhagic blood volume was reduced in PCC-treated animals (6.5 +/- 3.1 microL) compared to saline controls (15.3 +/- 11.2 microL, P = 0.015). In the saline group, 45% of mice developed large hematomas (i.e., >15 microL). On the other hand, such extensive lesions were never found in the PCC group. We provide experimental data suggesting that PCC is an effective acute treatment for W-ICH in terms of reducing hemorrhagic blood volume. Future studies are needed to evaluate the therapeutic potential arising from our findings in human W-ICH.\n",
      "PURPOSE: This is to present reversible lesions of the inferior colliculus in metronidazole-induced encephalopathy, to focus on diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) and fluid-attenuated inversion recovery imaging (FLAIR ). Materials and methods: From November 2005 to September 2007, 8 patients (5 men and 3 women) were diagnosed with metronidazole-induced encephalopathy (age range: 43 to 78 years). They took metronidazole (total dose, 45-120 g; duration, 30 days to 2 months) to treat infection of various organs. Baseline brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was obtained after hospitalization, including DWI (8/8), apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) map (4/8), FLAIR (7/8), and weighted image T2 (8/8). Follow-up MRIs were performed on 5 patients from the third to the 14th day after stopping metronidazole administration. The results of the initial and follow-up MRIs were retrospectively evaluated by 2 neuroradiologists by consensus, to analyze the presence of abnormal signal intensities, their locations, and signal changes on the follow-up images. RESULTS: Initial MRI scans showed abnormally high signal intensities on DWI and FLAIR (or T2-weighted image) at the dentate nucleus (8/8), inferior colliculus (6/8), corpus callosum (2/8). ), pons (2/8), medulla (1/8) and bilateral cerebral white matter (1/8). Lesions with high signal intensity on DWI tended to show low signal intensity on the ADC map (3/4), but in one patient, high signal intensity was shown at the bilateral dentate nuclei not only on the DWI card but also on the ADC card. All lesions of the dentate, inferior colliculus, pons, and medulla were completely resolved on follow-up MRIs in 5 patients, but in 1 of them the corpus callosum lesion persisted. CONCLUSIONS: Reversible lesions of the inferior colliculus could be considered characteristic of metronidazole-induced encephalopathy, alongside involvement of the dentate nucleus.\n",
      "OBJECTIVE: To identify mutations in the carbohydrate sulfotransferase (CHST6) gene for a Chinese family with corneal macular dystrophy (MCD) and study the histopathological changes in the affected cornea. METHODS:A corneal button from the proband was obtained by penetrating keratoplasty. The half-button and the ultrathin sections of the other half-button were examined separately with special dyes under an optical microscope (LM) and an electron microscope (EM). Genomic DNA was extracted from the peripheral blood of 11 family members, and the coding region of CHST6 was amplified by the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) method. PCR products were analyzed by direct sequencing and restriction enzyme digestion. RESULTS: The positive reaction to colloidal iron staining (extracellular blue accumulations in the stroma) was detected by light microscopy. Transmission electron microscopy revealed enlargement of the smooth endoplasmic reticulum and the presence of intracytoplasmic vacuoles. Compound heterozygous mutations, c.892C>T and c.1072T>C, were identified in exon 3 of CHST6 in three patients. Both transversions resulted in the substitution of a stop codon for glutamine at codon 298 (p.Q298X) and a missense mutation at codon 358, from tyrosine to histidine (p.Y358H). All six unaffected individuals in the family carried alternative heterozygous mutations. These two mutations were not detected in any of the 100 control subjects. CONCLUSIONS: These novel compound heterozygous mutations were thought to contribute to the loss of CHST6 function, which induced the abnormal metabolism of keratan sulfate (KS) deposited in the corneal stroma. This could be proven by microscopic observation of a positive reaction to stains and hypertrophies of collagen fibers as well as hyperplastic fibroblasts.\n",
      "Mucolipidosis type III (MLIII) is an autosomal recessive disorder affecting lysosomal hydrolase trafficking. In a study of 10 patients from seven families with a clinical phenotype and enzymatic diagnosis of MLIII, six novel mutations in the GNPTG gene were identified. These included missense (p.T286M) and nonsense (p.W111X) mutations and a transition in the obligatory AG dinucleotide of the intron 8 acceptor splice site (c.610- 2A>G). Three microdeletions were also identified, two of which (c.611delG and c.640_667del28) were located in the coding region while one (c.609+28_610-16del) was located entirely within intron 8. RT-PCR analysis from c. The 610-2A>G transition demonstrated that the change altered splicing, leading to the production of two distinct aberrantly spliced ​​forms, viz. the skipping of exon 9 (p.G204_K247del) or the retention of introns 8 and 9 (p.G204VfsX28). RT-PCR analysis, carried out on a patient homozygous for the intronic deletion (c.609+28_610-16del), did not detect any GNPTG RNA transcript. To determine whether transcripts derived from the c.609+28_610-16del allele were subject to nonsense-induced mRNA decay (NMD), patient fibroblasts were incubated with the inhibitor anisomycin of protein synthesis. An RT-PCR fragment retaining 43 bp of intron 8 was consistently detected, suggesting that the 33 bp genomic deletion had caused NMD. Quantitative real-time PCR and GNPTG Western blot analysis confirmed that homozygous p.G204VfsX17 microdeletion caused NMD, leading to failure of GNPTG protein synthesis. Analysis of the sequences surrounding the microdeletion breakpoints revealed either intrinsic repetitiveness of the deleted region or short direct repeats adjacent to the breakpoint junctions. This is consistent with the fact that these repeats mediated microdeletions via replication slippage and supports the idea that the mutational spectrum of the GNPTG gene is strongly influenced by properties of the local environment of the DNA sequence.\n",
      "Deoxyguanosine kinase (dGK) deficiency is a common cause of mitochondrial DNA depletion associated with a hepatocerebral phenotype. In this study, we describe a novel splice site mutation of the DGUOK gene and the clinical, radiological and genetic characteristics of these DGUOK patients. This novel homozygous DGUOK mutation (c.444-62C>A) was identified in three patients from two North African consanguineous families presenting both respiratory chain deficiencies and mitochondrial DNA depletion in the liver. Brain MRIs are normal in DGUOK patients in the literature. Interestingly, we found abnormal infratentorial myelination and moderate hyperintensity in bilateral pallidis in our patients. This new mutation creates a cryptic splice site in intron 3 (at position -62) and is expected to result in a larger protein with an in-frame insertion of 20 amino acids. In silico analysis of the putative impact of the insertion shows serious conflicts in the conformation of the protein: this insertion disrupts the alpha5 helix of the dGK kinase domain, rendering the protein unable to bind purine deoxyribonucleosides. Additionally, a common haplotype that segregated with disease in both families was detected by haplotype reconstruction with 10 markers (microsatellites and SNPs), which cover 4.6 Mb of DNA spanning the DGUOK locus. In conclusion, we report a novel DGUOK splice site mutation that provides insight into a critical protein domain (dGK kinase domain) and the first founder mutation in a North African population.\n",
      "The present study was designed to evaluate the cardioprotective potential of salvianolic acid A on isoproterenol-induced myocardial infarction in rats. Hemodynamic parameters and Lead II electrocardiograph were continuously monitored and recorded. Cardiac marker enzymes and antioxidant parameters in serum and cardiac tissues were measured. Mitochondrial respiratory function test and histopathological examination of cardiac tissues were performed. Isoproterenol-treated rats showed significant increases in lactate dehydrogenase, aspartate transaminase, creatine kinase, and malondialdehyde levels and significant decreases in superoxide dismutase, catalase, and glutathione peroxidase activities in the serum and the heart. These rats also showed a decrease in left ventricular systolic pressure, maximum and minimum rate of left ventricular developed pressure, and an elevation in left ventricular end-diastolic and ST segment pressure. Additionally, mitochondrial respiratory dysfunction characterized by decreased respiratory control ratio and ADP/O was observed in isoproterenol-treated rats. Administration of salvianolic acid A for a period of 8 days significantly attenuated isoproterenol-induced cardiac dysfunction and myocardial injury and improved mitochondrial respiratory function. The protective role of salvianolic acid A against isoproterenol-induced myocardial injury was confirmed by histopathological examination. The results of our study suggest that salvianolic acid A with antioxidant activity has a significant protective effect against isoproterenol-induced myocardial infarction.\n",
      "The melanocortin system is crucial for the regulation of energy homeostasis. Melanocortin type 4 receptor (MC4R) modulates insulin signaling via effects on c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK). The melanocortin agonist NDP-MSH dose-dependently inhibited JNK activity in HEK293 cells stably expressing human MC4R; the effects were reversed by the melanocortin receptor antagonist. NDP-MSH inhibited IRS-1 (ser307) phosphorylation in a time- and dose-dependent manner, effects also reversed by a specific melanocortin receptor antagonist. NDP-MSH increased insulin-stimulated AKT phosphorylation in vitro. The melanocortin agonist melanotan II increased insulin-stimulated AKT phosphorylation in the rat hypothalamus in vivo. NDP-MSH increased insulin-stimulated glucose uptake in hypothalamic GT1-1 cells. The present study shows that the melanocortinergic system interacts with insulin signaling via novel effects on JNK activity.\n",
      "Asthma is a chronic inflammatory disease of the airways. Several candidate genes have been identified that may play a role in the pathogenesis of asthma, including the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) gene. Our objective was to study the frequency of an ACE gene polymorphism in Turkish asthma patients and to determine its impact on clinical parameters and disease severity. Ninety-seven asthmatic patients (M/F 25/72, mean age 39 +/- 13 years) and 96 healthy subjects (M/F 26/70, mean age 38 +/- 12 years) were included. . At baseline, all participants completed a questionnaire on demographics, symptoms, precipitating factors, asthma severity, and presence of atopism. Blood samples were collected from all patients and genomic DNA was isolated. The frequency of ACE genotypes (I = insertion and D = deletion) in asthmatics and controls was compared: asthmatics showed a prevalence of 40.2% of the DD genotype (n = 39), ID was 45.4 % (n = 44) and II was 14.4% (n = 14.4). In control subjects, the frequency of DD was 18.8% (n = 18), ID was 50% (n = 48), and II was 31.3% (n = 30). The DD ACE genotype was significantly more frequent in asthmatics than in controls (p < 0.001). Asthmatics with the ID ACE genotype had a higher frequency of drug allergies, although this was not statistically significant (p = 0.08). Asthmatics with the DD genotype appeared to have a higher incidence of exacerbations of asthma episodes due to viral infections, but again this was not statistically significant (p = 0.08). Patients with mild or moderate-severe asthma had similar frequencies of these mutations. We found a higher frequency of ACE DD gene mutation in Turkish asthma patients compared to non-asthmatics, suggesting that this ACE gene polymorphism might be a risk factor for asthma but does not increase severity of the disease.\n",
      "BACKGROUND:Nephronophthisis (NPHP), a rare recessive cystic kidney disease, is the most common genetic cause of chronic kidney disease in children and young adults. Mutations in nine genes (NPHP1-9) were identified. NPHP may be associated with retinal degeneration (Senior-Loken syndrome), abnormalities of the brainstem and cerebellum (Joubert syndrome), or hepatic fibrosis. METHODS: To identify a causal gene for the subset of patients with associated liver fibrosis, the authors performed a genome-wide linkage search in a consanguineous family with three affected patients using 50K SNP microarrays and homozygosity mapping. RESULTS: The authors obtained a maximum significant parametric LOD (logarithm of odds) score of Z(max) = 3.72 on chromosome 8q22 and identified a homozygous missense mutation in the MKS3/TMEM67 gene. When examining a global cohort of 62 independent patients with NPHP and associated liver fibrosis, we identified a total of four novel mutations (p.W290L, p.C615R, p.G821S, and p.G821R) in five of them. MKS3/TMEM67 mutations, recently discovered in Meckel-Gruber syndrome (MKS) type 3 and Joubert syndrome (JBTS) type 6, are primarily truncating mutations. In contrast, the mutations detected here in patients with NPHP and associated liver fibrosis are exclusively missense mutations. This suggests that they might represent hypomorphic alleles, leading to a milder phenotype compared to the more severe MKS or JBTS phenotype. Additionally, mutation analysis for MKS3/TMEM67 in 120 patients with JBTS revealed seven different mutations (four novel) in five patients, four of whom also had congenital liver fibrosis. CONCLUSIONS: Hypomorphic mutations in MKS3/TMEM67 cause NPHP with liver fibrosis (NPHP11). This is the first report of MKS3 mutations in patients without vermian agenesis and neurological signs. Thus, NPHP, JBTS, and MKS represent allelic disorders.\n",
      "TGFbeta-activated kinase 1 (TAK1), a member of the MAPKKK family, controls diverse functions ranging from activation of the innate and adaptive immune system to vascular development and apoptosis. To analyze the in vivo function of TAK1 in cartilage, we generated mice with a conditional deletion of Tak1 driven by the collagen 2 promoter. Tak1(col2) mice exhibited severe chondrodysplasia with runings, impaired formation of centers secondary ossification and joint abnormalities, including elbow dislocation and tarsal fusion. This phenotype resembled that of bone morphogenetic protein receptor (BMPR) 1 and Gdf5-deficient mice. BMPR signaling was markedly impaired in TAK1-deficient chondrocytes, as evidenced by reduced expression of known BMP target genes as well as reduced phosphorylation of Smad1/5/8 and p38/Jnk/Erk MAP kinases. TAK1 mediates the phosphorylation of Smad1 at C-terminal serine residues. These results provide the first in vivo evidence in a mammalian system that TAK1 is required for BMP signaling and functions as an upstream activating kinase for Smad1/5/8 in addition to its known role in regulating MAP kinase pathways. . Our experiments reveal the essential role of TAK1 in cartilage morphogenesis, growth and maintenance.\n",
      "BACKGROUND: Treatment options are rare in patients with pretreated advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). RAD001, an oral mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) inhibitor, showed phase I efficacy in NSCLC. METHODS: Patients with stage IIIb or IV NSCLC who received at least two prior chemotherapy regimens, one platinum-based (stratum 1) or both chemotherapy and epidermal growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitors (stratum 2), received RAD001 10 mg/day until progression or unacceptable. toxicity. The primary objective was overall response rate (ORR). Analyzes of markers associated with the mTOR pathway were performed on archived tumors from a subgroup by immunohistochemistry (IHC) and direct mutation sequencing. RESULTS: Eighty-five patients were recruited, 42 in stratum 1 and 43 in stratum. The ORR was 4.7% (7.1% for stratum 1; 2.3% for stratum 2). The overall disease control rate was 47.1%. Median progression-free survivals (PFS) were 2.6 (stratum 1) and 2.7 months (stratum 2). Common events > or = grade 3 were fatigue, dyspnea, stomatitis, anemia and thrombocytopenia. Pneumonitis, probably or possibly related, mainly grade 1/2, occurred in 25% of cases. Cox regression analysis of IHC scores revealed that only phospho AKT (pAKT) was a significant independent predictor of worse PFS. CONCLUSIONS: RAD001 10 mg/day was well tolerated, showing modest clinical activity in pretreated NSCLC. Evaluation of RAD001 plus standard therapy for metastatic NSCLC continues.\n",
      "Autism spectrum disorders (ASD) are heterogeneous disorders with increased rates of anxiety. The adenosine A(2A) receptor gene (ADORA2A) is associated with panic disorder and is located on chromosome 22q11.23. Its gene product, adenosine A(2A) receptor, is highly expressed in the caudate nucleus, which is also implicated in ASD. As autistic symptoms are increased in individuals with 22q11.2 deletion syndrome and large 22q11.2 deletions and duplications have been observed in individuals with ASD, in this study 98 individuals with ASD and 234 control individuals were genotyped for eight single-nucleotide polymorphisms in ADORA2A. A nominal association with the disorder was observed for rs2236624-CC, and the phenotypic variability of ASD symptoms was influenced by rs3761422, rs5751876, and rs35320474. Additionally, the association of ADORA2A variants with anxiety has been replicated in individuals with ASD. The results suggest a possible mediating role of ADORA2A variants on the phenotypic expression of ASD which needs to be replicated in a larger sample.\n",
      "Molecular surveillance of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR TB) was implemented in Europe through case reporting in 2005. For all new cases of MDR TB detected between January 2003 and June 2007, countries reported epidemiological data based on cases and genetic fingerprint profiles of MDR TB strains. when available. International clusters were detected and analyzed. From 2003 to mid-2007 in Europe, 2,494 cases of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis were reported in 24 European countries. Epidemiological and molecular data were linked for 593 (39%) cases, and 672 insertion sequences and 6,110 DNA fingerprint patterns were reported from 19 countries. Among these models, 288 (43%) belonged to 18 European clusters; 7 clusters (242/288 cases, 84%) were characterized by strains from the Beijing genotype family, including the largest cluster (175/288 cases, 61%). The Beijing cluster and genotype were associated with strains originating from Eastern European countries. Detection of molecular clusters contributes to the identification of transmission profile, risk factors and control measures.\n",
      "Ecstasy users have consistently been shown to have impaired learning and memory performance. Furthermore, working memory processing in ecstasy users has been shown to be associated with neuronal alterations in hippocampal and/or cortical regions, as measured by functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Using functional imaging and a face learning task, we investigated the neural correlates of encoding and recall of face-name associations in 20 recreational drug users whose predominant use was ecstasy and 20 witnesses. To address potential confounding effects of cannabis use in the ecstasy-using group, a second analysis included 14 previously tested cannabis users (Nestor, L., Roberts, G., Garavan, H., Hester, R., 2008. Deficits in learning and memory: parahippocampal hyperactivity and frontocortical hypoactivity in cannabis users Neuroimage 40, 1328-1339). Ecstasy users performed significantly worse in learning and memory compared to controls and cannabis users. A joint analysis of the encoding and recall phases of the task revealed ecstasy-specific hyperactivity in bilateral frontal regions, left temporal, right parietal, bilateral temporal, and bilateral occipital brain regions. Ecstasy-specific hypoactivity was evident in the right dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) and left posterior cingulate cortex. In both the ecstasy and cannabis groups, brain activation was decreased in the right medial frontal gyrus, left parahippocampal gyrus, left dorsal cingulate gyrus, and left caudate. These results helped elucidate deficits linked to ecstasy, only part of which could be attributed to cannabis consumption. These ecstasy-specific effects may be related to the vulnerability of isocortical and allocortical regions to the neurotoxic effects of ecstasy.\n",
      "Endometrial cancer is the most common invasive gynecologic malignancy, but the molecular mechanisms and signaling pathways underlying its etiology and pathophysiology remain poorly characterized. We sought to define a functional role for the protein kinase C (PKC) isoform, PKCalpha, in an established cellular model of endometrial adenocarcinoma. Ishikawa cells lacking PKCalpha protein grew more slowly, formed fewer colonies in anchorage-independent growth assays, and exhibited impaired xenograft tumor formation in nude mice. Consistent with impaired growth, PKCalpha knockdown increased the levels of the cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) inhibitors p21 (Cip1/WAF1) (p21) and p27 (Kip1) (p27). Despite the absence of functional protein phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) in Ishikawa cells, knockdown of PKCalpha reduced Akt phosphorylation at serine 473 and concomitantly inhibited Akt phosphorylation. target of Akt, glycogen synthase kinase-3beta (GSK-3beta). Knockdown of PKCalpha also resulted in decreased basal ERK phosphorylation and attenuation of ERK activation following EGF stimulation. Expression of p21 and p27 was not increased by treatment of Ishikawa cells with ERK and Akt inhibitors, suggesting that PKCalpha regulates CDK expression independently of Akt and ERK. Immunohistochemical analysis of grade 1 endometrioid adenocarcinoma revealed aberrant PKCalpha expression, with foci of elevated PKCalpha staining, not observed in normal endometrium. These studies demonstrate the essential role of PKCalpha signaling in endometrial tumorigenesis by regulating the expression of CDK inhibitors p21 and p27 and the activation of Akt- and ERK-dependent proliferation pathways. Thus, targeting PKCalpha could offer new therapeutic options in endometrial tumors.\n",
      "Cocaine is a risk factor for ischemic and hemorrhagic stroke. We present the case of a 31-year-old man with bilateral ischemia of the globus pallidus after excessive consumption of alcohol and intranasal cocaine. Drug-related globus pallidus infarctions are most commonly associated with heroin. Bilateral basal ganglia infarcts after cocaine use, without concomitant heroin use, have never been reported. In our patient, transient cardiac arrhythmia or respiratory dysfunction related to cocaine and/or ethanol consumption were the most likely causes of cerebral hypoperfusion.\n",
      "OBJECTIVE: We present the case of a patient who developed seizures shortly after initiation of levofloxacin treatment and discuss potential drug interactions related to cytochrome P450 (CYP) 1A2 inhibition in this case, as well as in other cases. other cases of convulsions induced by levofloxacin. METHODS: Several biomedical databases were searched, including MEDLINE, Cochrane and Ovid. The main search terms used were case report and levofloxacin. The search was limited to studies published in English. RESULTS: Six cases of levofloxacin-induced seizures have been reported in the literature. Drug interactions related to CYP1A2 inhibition by levofloxacin are probably involved in the clinical course of these cases. CONCLUSIONS:Clinicians are urged to take particular care when initiating levofloxacin therapy in patients taking medications with epileptogenic properties that are CYP1A2 substrates.\n",
      "This study was designed to evaluate the effects of pilocarpine and explore the underlying ionic mechanism, using both aconitine-induced arrhythmia models in rats and ouabain-induced arrhythmia in guinea pigs. Confocal microscopy was used to measure intracellular concentrations of free calcium ([Ca(2+)](i)) in isolated myocytes. Current data showed that pilocarpine significantly delayed the onset of arrhythmias, decreased the development of ventricular tachycardia and fibrillation, reduced the arrhythmia score, and increased the survival time of arrhythmic rats and guinea pigs. [Ca(2+)](i) overload induced by aconitine or ouabain was reduced in isolated myocytes pretreated with pilocarpine. Additionally, the M(3)-muscarinic acetylcholine receptor (mAChR) antagonist, 4-DAMP (4-diphenylacetoxy-N-methylpiperidine-methiodide), partially abolished the beneficial effects of pilocarpine. These data suggest that pilocarpine produced antiarrhythmic actions in aconitine- or ouabain-induced rat and guinea pig arrhythmic models via stimulation of cardiac M(3)-mAChR. The mechanism may be linked to improved Ca(2+) management.\n",
      "Schizophrenia was initially associated with dysfunction of dopaminergic neurotransmission. However, the observation that N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) glutamate receptor antagonists produce schizophrenic-like symptoms in humans has led to the idea of ​​dysfunction of the glutamatergic system via its NMDA receptor. . Accordingly, there is growing interest in the development of pharmacological agents with potential antipsychotic properties that enhance the activity of the glutamatergic system via modulation of the NMDA receptor. Among them are glycine transporter-1 (GlyT1) inhibitors such as SSR103800, which indirectly improve NMDA receptor function by increasing levels of glycine (an NMDA receptor co-agonist) in the synapse. This study aimed to investigate the potential antipsychotic-like properties of SSR103800, with particular emphasis on hyperactivity models, involving either drug challenge (i.e., amphetamine and MK-801) or transgenic mice ( i.e. NMDA Nr1(neo-/-) and DAT(-/-)). The results showed that SSR103800 (10-30 mg/kg p.o.) blocked the hyperactivity induced by the non-competitive NMDA receptor antagonist MK-801 and partially reversed the spontaneous hyperactivity of Nr1(neo-/-) NMDA mice. ). In contrast, SSR103800 failed to affect amphetamine-induced or naturally observed hyperactivity in dopamine transporter (DAT(-/-)) knockout mice (10-30 mg/kg po). It is important to note that both conventional (haloperidol) and atypical (olanzapine, clozapine, and aripiprazole) antipsychotics have been shown to be effective in all of these hyperactivity models. However, unlike the latter, SSR103800 did not produce catalepsy (retention to the bar test) up to 30 mg/kg p.o. Together, these results show that the GlyT1 inhibitor, SSR103800, produces effects of antipsychotic type, which differ from those seen with compounds primarily targeting the dopamine system, and has a reduced potential for side effects compared to the latter drugs.\n",
      "Hypokalemic periodic paralysis (HypoPP) is an autosomal dominant disorder characterized by periodic attacks of muscle weakness associated with decreased serum potassium levels. A major pathogenic gene for HypoPP was identified as CACNA1S, which encodes the skeletal muscle calcium channel alpha subunit with four transmembrane domains (I-IV), each with six transmembrane segments (S1-S6). To date, all CACNA1S mutations identified in HypoPP patients are located in the S4 segment of the voltage sensor. In this study, we report a novel CACNA1S mutation in a novel region of the protein, the S3 segment of domain III. We characterized a four-generation South American family with HypoPP. Genetic analysis identified a novel V876E mutation in all HypoPP patients in the family, but not in normal family members or in 160 controls. Clinical analysis indicates that the V876E mutation is associated with a serious course characterized by a very early age of onset, complete penetrance and a severe prognosis up to death. These results identify a novel mutation in CACNA1S and expand the spectrum of CACNA1S mutations associated with HypoPP.\n",
      "Vitamin D is associated with a reduced risk of various cancers, including colon cancer. Vitamin D receptor (VDR) is a transcription factor that plays an important role in cell differentiation and inhibition of proliferation. A link between VDR and the RAS mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) or phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)-AKT pathway has been suggested. However, the prognostic role of VDR expression or its relationship with PIK3CA or KRAS mutation remains unclear. Among 619 colorectal cancers in two prospective cohort studies, 233 (38%) tumors showed VDR overexpression by immunohistochemistry. We analyzed PIK3CA and KRAS mutations and LINE-1 methylation by pyrosequencing, microsatellite instability (MSI), and DNA methylation (epigenetic changes) in eight promoters specific for the CpG island methylator phenotype ( CIMP) [CACNA1G, CDKN2A (p16), CRABP1, IGF2, MLH1, NEUROG1, RUNX3 and SOCS1] by MethyLight (real-time PCR). VDR overexpression was significantly associated with KRAS mutation (odds ratio, 1.55; 95% confidence interval, 1.11-2.16) and PIK3CA mutation (odds ratio, 2.17 ; 95% confidence interval, 1.36-3.47), both of which persisted in multivariate logistic regression. analysis. VDR was not independently associated with body mass index, family history of colorectal cancer, tumor location (colon versus rectum), stage, tumor grade, ring cells signet ring, CIMP, MSI, LINE-1 hypomethylation, BRAF, p53, p21, beta-catenin or cyclooxygenase-2. VDR expression was not significantly related to patient survival, prognosis, or clinical outcomes. In conclusion, VDR overexpression in colorectal cancer is independently associated with PIK3CA and KRAS mutations. Our data support potential interactions between the VDR, RAS-MAPK, and PI3K-AKT pathways, as well as the possible influence of KRAS or PIK3CA mutation on VDR-targeted treatment or chemoprevention.\n",
      "Histamine regulates functions via four receptors (HRH1, HRH2, HRH3 and HRH4). The d-myo-inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP(3))/Ca(2+)/protein kinase C (PKC)/mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway regulates cholangiocarcinoma growth. We evaluated the role of HRH3 in regulating cholangiocarcinoma growth. HRH3 expression in intrahepatic and extrahepatic cell lines, normal cholangiocytes, and human tissue networks was measured. In Mz-ChA-1 cells stimulated with (R)-(alpha)-(-)-methylhistamine dihydrobromide (RAMH), we measured (a) cell growth, (b) IP(3) levels ) and cyclic AMP, and (c) phosphorylation of PKC and mitogen-activated protein kinase isoforms. Localization of PKCalpha was visualized by immunofluorescence in cell smears and by immunoblotting for PKCalpha in cytosol and membrane fractions. After PKCalpha knockdown, Mz-ChA-1 cells were stimulated with RAMH before assessing cell growth and extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK)-1/2 phosphorylation. In vivo experiments were performed on BALB/c nude mice. Mice were treated with saline or RAMH for 44 days and tumor volume was measured. Tumors were excised and assessed for proliferation, apoptosis, and expression of PKCalpha, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-A, VEGF-C, VEGF receptor 2, and VEGF receptor 3. HRH3 expression was found in all cells. RAMH inhibited the growth of cholangiocarcinoma cells. RAMH increased IP(3) levels and PKCalpha phosphorylation and decreased ERK1/2 phosphorylation. RAMH induced a shift in the localization of PKCalpha expression from the cytosolic domain to the membrane region of Mz-ChA-1 cells. Knockdown of PKCalpha prevented RAMH inhibition of Mz-ChA-1 cell growth and abolished the effects of RAMH on ERK1/2 phosphorylation. In vivo, RAMH decreased tumor growth and expression of VEGF and its receptors; PKCalpha expression was increased. RAMH inhibits cholangiocarcinoma growth through PKCalpha-dependent ERK1/2 dephosphorylation. Modulation of PKCalpha by histamine receptors may play an important role in regulating cholangiocarcinoma growth.\n",
      "BACKGROUND: Little is known about the possible role of crack cocaine use on the incidence of HIV infection. Given the increasing use of crack cocaine, we sought to determine whether use of this illicit drug had become a risk factor for HIV infection. METHODS: We included data from people participating in the Vancouver Injection Drug Users Study who reported injecting illicit drugs at least once in the month before enrollment, lived in the greater Vancouver area, were HIV negative at the time of registration and have completed at least one follow-up. study visit. To determine whether the risk of HIV seroconversion among daily crack smokers changed over time, we used Cox proportional hazards regression and divided the study into 3 time periods: May 1, 1996–Nov. November 30, 1999 (Period 1), December 1 1999-Nov. December 30, 2002 (period 2) and December 1, 2002-Dec. 30, 2005 (period 3). RESULTS: A total of 1048 eligible injection drug users were included in our study. Among them, 137 acquired HIV infection during follow-up. The average proportion of participants reporting daily crack smoking increased from 11.6% in Period 1 to 39.7% in Period 3. After adjusting for potential confounders, we found that the risk of HIV seroconversion among participants who smoked crack daily increased. over time (period 1: relative risk [HR] 1.03, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.57-1.85; period 2: HR 1.68, 95% CI 1.01- 2.80; and period 3: HR 2.74, 95% CI 1.06-7.11). INTERPRETATION: Smoking crack cocaine was found to be an independent risk factor for HIV seroconversion among injection drug users. This finding highlights the urgent need for evidence-based public health initiatives targeting people who smoke crack cocaine.\n",
      "BACKGROUND:Psoriasis is a common dermatological disease in which autoimmunity plays an important role. It has been suggested that CD4(+)CD25(+) regulatory T cells (T-regs) are involved in the pathogenesis of certain autoimmune diseases. T-regs express the forkhead/winged propeller transcription factor, FOXP3, which appears to play a key role in T-reg development and function. Studies have shown that single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the FOXP3 gene contribute to susceptibility to certain autoimmune diseases. However, information on the FOXP3 gene in psoriasis is limited. OBJECTIVE:This study evaluated the association between FOXP3 gene SNPs and psoriasis susceptibility in a Han Chinese population. METHODS: In a hospital-based case-control study, 524 patients with psoriasis and 549 controls without psoriasis were recruited based on age and sex. We studied four SNPs in the FOXP3 gene (-6054, deletion/ATT; -3279, A/C; -924, A/G; IVS9+459, A/G) in psoriasis patients and evaluated the frequencies of alleles and genotypes in psoriatic patients. patients (237 women, 287 men) and normal controls (272 women, 277 men). Polymorphisms were genotyped using PCR sequence-specific primer (PCR-SSP) technique and PCR restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) analysis. RESULTS: We found that an increased risk of psoriasis was associated with the FOXP3 -3279 AC genotype (adjusted OR, 1.32; 95% CI, 1.01-1.74) and the combined AC+AA genotype (OR adjusted, 1.38; 95% CI, 1.07). -1.78), compared to the -3279 CC genotype. We also found that an increased risk of psoriasis was associated with FOXP3 IVS9+459 GG genotype (adjusted OR, 2.24; 95% CI, 1.41-3.58). However, the combined GA+GG genotype showed no such trend (adjusted OR = 1.28; 95% CI, 1.00-1.64), compared to the IVS9+459 AA genotype. There was no evidence of increased risk associated with the FOXP3-6054 deletion/ATT or FOXP3-924 A/G genotype. In combined genotypic analyses, the FOXP3-3279 AC+AA genotype was more clearly associated in men (adjusted OR = 1.60, 95% CI = 1.11-2.31) and patients with severe psoriasis ( PASI score > 20; adjusted OR = 1.97, 95% CI = 1.41-2.75). Meanwhile, the FOXP3 IVS9+459 GA+GG genotype was also associated with patients with severe psoriasis (adjusted OR = 1.69, 95% CI = 1.21-2.36). CONCLUSIONS:FOXP3 polymorphisms appear to contribute to psoriasis risk in a Han Chinese population. Larger studies are needed to confirm these results.\n",
      "Human 8-oxoguanine DNA glycosylase 1 (hOGG1) plays a major role in the repair of 8-hydroxyguanine, a major promogenic DNA lesion. The genetic polymorphism rs1052133, which leads to the substitution of the amino acid at codon 326 from Ser to Cys, exhibits functional differences, namely decreased enzymatic activity in hOGG1-Cys326. Although several studies have investigated the association between rs1052133 and lung cancer susceptibility, the effect of this locus on lung cancer according to histology remains unclear. We therefore conducted a case-control study with 515 incident cases of lung cancer and 1,030 age- and sex-matched controls without cancer, and then conducted a meta-analysis. In the overall analysis, homozygous Cys/Cys genotype showed a significant association with lung cancer compared to Ser allele carrier status (odds ratio (OR) = 1.31, confidence interval (CI ) at 95% = 1.02-1.69). By histological analysis, Cys/Cys genotype showed a significantly positive association with small cell carcinoma (OR = 2.40, 95% CI = 1.32-4.49) and a marginally significant association with adenocarcinoma (OR = 1.32, 95% CI = 0.98). -1.77). A meta-analysis of previous and current studies found that this polymorphism is positively associated with adenocarcinoma, although suggestive associations were also found for squamous cell and small cell lung cancers. These results indicate that rs1052133 contributes to the risk of lung adenocarcinoma.\n",
      "Hepatitis B virus (HBV) immune evasion variants represent an emerging clinical challenge, as they may be associated with vaccine evasion, HBV reactivation, and diagnostic test failure. Recent data suggest preferential selection of immune evasion mutants in distinct compartments of peripheral blood leukocytes of infected individuals. We therefore systematically analyzed the functional impact of the most prevalent immune evasion variants, the sG145R and sP120T mutants, on the viral replication efficiency and antiviral drug sensitivity of common treatment-associated mutants exhibiting resistance to lamivudine (LAM) and/or HBeAg negativity. Replication-competent HBV strains with resistance to sG145R or sP120T and LAM (rtM204I or rtL180M/rtM204V) were generated on an HBeAg-positive and HBeAg-negative background with precore (PC) and basal core promoter (BCP) mutants. ). The sG145R mutation strongly reduced HBsAg levels and was able to completely restore the impaired replication of AML-resistant HBV mutants to wild-type HBV levels, and PC or BCP mutations further enhanced viral replication. Although the sP120T substitution also impaired HBsAg secretion, it did not enhance the replication of AML-resistant clones. However, the concomitant appearance of HBeAg negativity (PC/BCP), sP120T resistance, and AML resulted in restoration of replication to wild-type HBV levels. In all clones with combined immune escape and AML resistance mutations, the nucleotide analogues adefovir and tenofovir remained effective in suppressing viral replication in vitro. These results reveal the differential impact of immune evasion variants on the replication and drug sensitivity of HBV complex mutants, supporting the need for close monitoring and treatment adjustment in response to mutational pattern selection distinct.\n",
      "Antiplatelet therapy with clopidogrel is currently the standard of care for patients with coronary artery disease undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention. However, approximately 25% of patients have a subtherapeutic antiplatelet response. Clopidogrel is a prodrug that undergoes hepatic biotransformation by CYP2C19 to its active metabolite. Several studies have reported that, compared to wild-type individuals, carriers of CYP2C19 variant alleles exhibit a significantly lower ability to metabolize clopidogrel to its active metabolite and inhibit platelet activation, and therefore present a significantly lower risk higher rate of adverse cardiovascular events. Therefore, the US FDA recently amended the prescribing information for clopidogrel to highlight the impact of CYP2C19 genotype on the pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, and clinical response of clopidogrel. Future studies remain necessary to develop effective personalized therapeutic strategies for carriers of CYP2C19 variant alleles and others at risk for clopidogrel nonresponsiveness.\n",
      "Cancer patients who were treated with adjuvant systemic chemotherapy described deteriorations in their cognitive functions. A widely used chemotherapeutic agent, 5-fluorouracil (5-FU), readily crosses the blood-brain barrier and thus may have a direct effect on brain function. This antimitotic drug could notably reduce cell proliferation in neurogenic regions of the adult brain. In contrast, reports indicate that hippocampus-dependent neurogenesis and cognition are enhanced by the SSRI antidepressant Fluoxetine. In this investigation, the behavioral effects of chronic treatment (two weeks) with 5-FU and (three weeks) with Fluoxetine, either separately or in combination with 5-FU, were tested in adult Lister hooded rats. . Behavioral effects were tested using a context-dependent conditioned emotional response (CER) test which showed that 5-FU-treated animals had a significant reduction in freezing time compared to controls. A separate group of animals was tested using a test of hippocampus-dependent spatial working memory, the Object Location Recognition (OLR) test. Animals treated only with 5-FU showed significant deficits in their ability to perform the OLR task, but co-administration of Fluoxetine improved their performance. 5-FU chemotherapy resulted in a significant reduction in the number of proliferating cells in the subgranular zone of the dentate gyrus compared to controls. This reduction was eliminated when Fluoxetine was co-administered with 5-FU. Fluoxetine alone had no effect on the number or behavior of proliferating cells. These results suggest that 5-FU can negatively affect both cell proliferation and hippocampus-dependent working memory and that these deficits can be reversed by concurrent administration of the antidepressant Fluoxetine.\n",
      "BACKGROUND: Vasopressor agents are used to correct anesthesia-induced hypotension. We describe the effect of phenylephrine and ephedrine on frontal lobe oxygenation (S(c)O(2)) following anesthesia-induced hypotension. METHODS: After induction of anesthesia with fentanyl (0.15 mg kg(-1)) and propofol (2.0 mg kg(-1)), 13 patients received phenylephrine (0.1 mg iv ) and 12 patients received ephedrine (10 mg iv) to restore mean arterial pressure (MAP). Heart rate (HR), MAP, stroke volume (SV), cardiac output (CO), and frontal lobe oxygenation (S(c)O(2)) were recorded. RESULTS: Induction of anesthesia was followed by a decrease in MAP, HR, SV and CO concomitant with an increase in S(c)O(2). After phenylephrine administration, MAP increased (51 +/- 12 to 81 +/- 13 mmHg; P < 0.001; mean +/- SD). However, a 14% reduction (from 70 +/- 8% to 60 +/- 7%) of S(c)O(2) (P < 0.05) followed without a change in CO (3.7 + /- 1.1 to 3.4 +/- 0.9 l min(-1)). Ephedrine administration resulted in a similar increase in MAP (53 +/- 9 to 79 +/- 8 mmHg; P < 0.001), restored CO (3.2 +/- 1.2 to 5.0 +/- 1.3 l min(-1) ), and preserved S(c)O(2). CONCLUSIONS: The use of phenylephrine to correct anesthesia-induced hypotension negatively impacts S(c)O(2) while ephedrine maintains frontal lobe oxygenation potentially linked to increased CO .\n",
      "BACKGROUND: In 2 separate centers, we observed a notable increase in the incidence of postoperative seizures from 1.3% to 3.8% in patients who underwent major cardiac surgical procedures. These events coincided temporally with the initial use of high-dose tranexamic acid (TXA) therapy after aprotinin was withdrawn from general clinical use. The aim of this review was to perform a retrospective analysis to examine whether there was a relationship between TXA use and seizures after cardiac surgery. METHODS: A thorough chart review was undertaken in all 24 patients who developed perioperative seizures. Electroencephalographic activity was recorded in 11 of these patients, and all patients underwent formal neurological evaluation and brain imaging studies. RESULTS: Twenty-one of 24 patients had no evidence of new ischemic brain injury, but seizures were likely due to ischemic brain injury in 3 patients. Not all patients with seizures had permanent neurological abnormalities. The 24 patients with seizures received high doses of TXA intraoperatively, ranging from 61 to 259 mg/kg, had a mean age of 69.9 years, and 21 of 24 had undergone open-chamber procedures rather than coronary artery bypass grafts. . All patients except one were managed by extracorporeal circulation. No evidence of ischemic, metabolic, or hyperthermia-induced brain causes for their seizures was apparent. CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that the use of high doses of TXA in elderly patients in conjunction with cardiopulmonary bypass and open-chamber cardiac surgery is associated with clinical seizures in susceptible patients.\n",
      "BACKGROUND:Mice with defects in the Klotho gene exhibit multiple aging phenotypes, including arteriosclerosis. We hypothesized that the G-395A polymorphism in the promoter region of the human Klotho gene may contribute to the prevalence of essential hypertension (EH). METHODS: We study whether Klotho G-395A polymorphism is associated with HE in a population consisting of 215 HE patients and 220 non-hypertensive subjects. We also tested whether a G/A substitution at the G-395A site affected the level of transcription in vitro using the dual luciferase reporter assay. RESULTS: The differences in the genotypic distributions of the G-395A polymorphism between the EH and non-hypertensive groups were statistically significant (P = 0.032). There are differential effects by age, sex, and smoking status on the association of the G-395A polymorphism with HE; the G-395A polymorphism is significantly associated with HE in subjects over 60 years of age, in women and in non-smokers. Multiple logistic regression analysis indicated that the odds ratio of HE in -395A allele carriers compared with the control group was 0.593 (P = 0.024) after adjustment for current traditional risk factors. The dual luciferase reporter assay revealed that the -395A carrier of a 498 bp DNA fragment (containing the G-395A site) upstream of the Klotho gene has higher relative luciferase activity than the -395G carrier. CONCLUSIONS: The G-395A polymorphism of the human Klotho gene is associated with HE and may be a potential regulatory site.\n",
      "BACKGROUND: Neuroinflammation occurs after seizures and is involved in epileptogenesis. CCR2 is a chemokine receptor for CCL2 and their interaction mediates monocyte infiltration in the neuroinflammatory cascade triggered in different brain pathologies. In this work, the expression of CCR2 and CCL2 was examined following status epilepticus (SE) induced by pilocarpine injection. METHODS:SE was induced by pilocarpine injection. Control rats were injected with saline instead of pilocarpine. Five days after SE, CCR2 staining in neurons and glial cells was examined using immunohistochemical analyses. The number of CCR2-positive cells was determined using stereological probes in the hippocampus. The expression of CCL2 in the hippocampus was examined by molecular assay. RESULTS: An increase in CCR2 was observed in the hippocampus after SE. Seizures also led to alterations in CCR2-expressing cell types. An increased number of CCR2-expressing neurons was observed after SE. Microglial cells were more closely related to CCR2-labeled cells in SE rats. Additionally, SE rats exhibited CCR2 labeling in hypertrophied astrocyte populations, particularly in CA1 and the dentate gyrus. These CCR2+ astroctytes were not observed in control rats. Examination of CCL2 expression showed that it was elevated in the hippocampus after SE. CONCLUSION: Data show that CCR2 and CCL2 are upregulated in the hippocampus after pilocarpine-induced SE. Seizures also cause changes in CCR2 receptor expression in neurons and astrocytes. These changes could be involved in detrimental neuroplasticity and neuroinflammatory changes that occur following seizures.\n",
      "The integrity of the hippocampus is essential for cognitive functions. On the other hand, the induction of metallothionein (MT) by ZnSO(4) and its role in neuroprotection have been documented. The present study aimed to explore the effect of MT induction on carmustine (BCNU)-induced hippocampal cognitive dysfunction in rats. A total of 60 male Wistar albino rats were randomly divided into four groups (15/group): the control group was injected with single doses of normal saline (icv), followed 24 h later by BCNU solvent ( iv). The second group administered ZnSO(4) (0.1 micromol/10 microl normal saline, icv, once), followed by BCNU solvent (iv) after 24 h. The third group received BCNU (20 mg/kg, i.v., once) 24 h after normal saline injection (i.c.v). The fourth group received a single dose of ZnSO(4) (0.1 micromol/10 microl of normal saline, icv) then BCNU (20 mg/kg, i.v, once) after 24 h. The obtained data revealed that BCNU administration led to deterioration in learning and short-term memory (STM), measured using a radial arm water maze, accompanied by a decrease of hippocampal glutathione reductase (GR) activity and reduced glutathione (GSH) content. Furthermore, BCNU administration increased serum tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFalpha), hippocampal MT, and malondialdehyde (MDA) content as well as caspase-3 activity in addition to histological alterations. ZnSO(4) pretreatment counteracted BCNU-induced GR inhibition and GSH depletion and resulted in a significant reduction in MDA and TNFalpha levels as well as caspase-3 activity. Histological features were improved in the hippocampus of rats treated with ZnSO(4) + BCNU compared to animals treated only with BCNU. In conclusion, induction of MT stops BCNU-induced hippocampal toxicity because it prevents GR inhibition and GSH depletion and counteracts increased levels of TNFalpha, MDA, and caspase activity. 3, with subsequent preservation of cognition.\n",
      "OBJECTIVE:We examined the genetic association of promoter insertion/deletion (indel) in the IRF5 gene with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) in distinct populations and assessed its role in gene expression. METHODS: Four IRF5 polymorphisms were genotyped in 1,488 SLE patients and 1,466 controls. Gene expression was analyzed by real-time quantitative PCR using RNA from peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). RESULTS:The indel promoter and rs2070197 had independent genetic effects, which explained the association of rs2004640 and rs10954213. Gene expression analysis revealed that rs10954213 exerted the greatest influence on IRF5 transcript levels. CONCLUSION:We corroborated the association of indel promoter with SLE in 5 different populations and revealed that rs10954213 is the main single nucleotide polymorphism responsible for altered IRF5 expression in PBMCs.\n",
      "BACKGROUND: The prevalence of obesity is increasing to pandemic proportions. However, obese subjects differ in insulin resistance, adipokine production and comorbidities. Based on analysis of fasting plasma, obese subjects were grouped into low acylation-stimulating protein (ASP) and triglyceride (TG) (LAT) versus high ASP and TG (HAT). Subcutaneous (SC) and omental (OM) adipose tissues (n = 21) were analyzed by microarray, and the biological pathways of lipid metabolism and inflammation were specifically examined. METHODS:LAT and HAT groups were matched for age, obesity, insulin and glucose, and showed similar expression of insulin-related genes (InsR, IRS-1). ASP-related genes tended to be increased in the HAT group and were correlated (factor B, adipsin, complement C3, p < 0.01 each). Differences between the LAT and HAT groups were almost exclusively in SC tissues, with few differences in OM tissues. An increase in C5L2 (p < 0.01), an ASP receptor, in HAT suggests a compensatory ASP pathway, associated with increased TG storage. RESULTS: HAT adipose tissue demonstrated an increase in lipid-related genes for storage (CD36, DGAT1, DGAT2, SCD1, FASN and LPL), lipolysis (HSL, CES1, perilipin), acid-binding proteins fat (FABP1, FABP3) and adipocyte differentiation markers (CEBPalpha, CEBPbeta, PPARgamma). In contrast, genes related to oxidation decreased (AMPK, UCP1, CPT1, FABP7). HAT subjects had increased anti-inflammatory genes TGFB1, TIMP1, TIMP3, and TIMP4, while proinflammatory genes PIG7 and MMP2 were also significantly increased; all genes, p < 0.025. CONCLUSION: Taken together, the profile of C5L2 receptor, ASP gene expression and metabolic factors in adipose tissue of morbidly obese HAT subjects suggests a compensatory response associated with increased plasma ASP and TG.\n",
      "U87MG is a commonly studied grade IV glioma cell line that has been analyzed in at least 1,700 publications over four decades. To comprehensively characterize the genome of this cell line and serve as a model for large-scale sequencing of the cancer genome, we generated >30-fold genome sequence coverage using a novel 50-base pairing strategy with an average insert library of 1.4 KB. A total of 1,014,984,286 two-base encoded reads and 120,691,623 single-end two-base encoded reads were generated from five slides. All data was aligned using a custom-designed tool called BFAST, enabling optimal alignment of color space reading and accurate identification of DNA variants. Aligned sequence reads and mate pair information identified 35 interchromosomal translocation events, 1,315 structural variations (>100 bp), 191,743 small (<21 bp) insertions and deletions (indels), and 2,384,470 variations single nucleotides (SNV). Among these observations, the known homozygous mutation in PTEN was robustly identified and genes involved in cell adhesion were overrepresented in the list of mutated genes. Data were compared to 219,187 heterozygous single nucleotide polymorphisms analyzed by the Illumina 1M Duo Genotyping Array to assess accuracy: 93.83% of all SNPs were reliably detected at filter thresholds that yield sequence accuracy greater than 99.99%. Protein coding sequences were disrupted primarily in this cancer cell line due to small indels, large deletions, and translocations. A total of 512 genes were homozygously mutated, including 154 by SNV, 178 by small indels, 145 by large microdeletions, and 35 by interchromosomal translocations to reveal a highly mutated cell line genome. Among the homozygously mutated small variants, 8 SNVs and 99 indels were novel events not present in dbSNP. These data demonstrate that the systematic generation of a large cancer genome sequence is possible outside of genome centers. Sequence analysis of U87MG provides an unprecedented level of mutational resolution compared to any cell line to date.\n",
      "The most serious adverse effects of carbamazepine were observed in the hematopoietic system, liver and cardiovascular system. A frequently fatal, although exceptionally rare, side effect of carbamazepine is eosinophilic necrotizing myocarditis (hypersensitivity). We report a case of hypersensitivity myocarditis secondary to the administration of carbamazepine. Acute hypersensitivity myocarditis was not suspected clinically and the diagnosis was made postmortem. Histology revealed diffuse infiltration of the myocardium by eosinophils and lymphocytes with myocyte damage. Clinically, death was due to cardiogenic shock. To our knowledge, this is the second case of carbamazepine-induced fatal myocarditis reported in the English literature.\n",
      "Apparent homozygosity for the p.R315X mutation present on exon 5 of the arylsulfatase B (ARSB) gene in a patient with mucopolysaccharidosis type VI was resolved in this study by additional testing for a second mutation. Analysis of the patient's cDNA revealed that the entire exon 5 of the ARSB gene was missing; this new mutation was identified as c.899-1142del. As genomic DNA sequencing excluded the presence of splicing mutations, polymerase chain reaction analysis was performed for the polymorphisms listed in the NCBI SNP database for the ARSB gene. This identified the mutation at the genomic DNA level as g.99367-102002del; this gross deletion, involving the entire exon 5 of the gene and parts of introns 4 and 5, led to a frameshift starting at amino acid 300 and resulting in a protein with 39% different amino acids of the normal enzyme. We emphasize that a thorough DNA analysis should be carried out in cases of apparent homozygosity to avoid possible genetic counseling errors.\n",
      "Chordin is the prototype of a group of cysteine-rich domain-containing proteins that bind and modulate the signaling of various TGFbeta-like ligands. Chordin-like 1 and 2 (CHL1 and 2) are two members of this group that have been described in humans, mice and chicks. However, the in vivo roles of CHL1 and 2 during early development are unknown due to the lack of loss-of-function analysis. Here, we identify and characterize the zebrafish, Danio rerio, CHL (Chl). The chl gene is found on a region of chromosome 21 syntenic with the area of ​​murine chromosome 7 carrying the CHL2 gene. The failure to identify a distinct zebrafish gene corresponding to the mammalian CHL1 gene suggests that Chl may play a role in zebrafish split between CHL1 and CHL2 in other species. Chl is a maternal factor that is also expressed zygotically later in development and exhibits spatiotemporal expression patterns that differ from, but overlap with, those of zebrafish cordin (Chd), suggesting differences but also a possible overlap in the developmental roles of the two proteins. Chl, like Chd, dorsalizes embryos upon overexpression and is cleaved by BMP1, antagonizing this activity. Loss-of-function experiments demonstrate that Chl serves as a BMP antagonist with functions that overlap and are redundant with those of Chd in dorsoventral axis formation.\n",
      "OBJECTIVE:The aim of the present study was to investigate the effect of risperidone-induced hyperprolactinemia on trabecular bone mineral density (BMD) in children and adolescents. METHOD: Medically healthy males aged 7 to 17 years treated chronically, in a naturalistic setting, with risperidone were recruited for this cross-sectional study from outpatient child psychiatry clinics between November 2005 and June 2007. Anthropometric and laboratory tests were carried out. . Clinical diagnoses were based on chart review, and developmental and treatment histories were obtained from the medical record. Volumetric BMD of the ultradistal radius was measured using peripheral quantitative computed tomography, and areal BMD of the lumbar spine was estimated using dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry. RESULTS: Hyperprolactinemia was present in 49% of 83 boys (n=41) treated with risperidone for a mean duration of 2.9 years. Serum testosterone concentration increased with pubertal status but was not affected by hyperprolactinemia. As expected, bone mineral content and BMD increased with sexual maturity. After adjusting for stage of sexual development, height, and BMI z-scores, serum prolactin was negatively associated with trabecular volumetric BMD at the ultradistal radius (P < 0.03). Controlling for relevant covariates, we also found that treatment with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) was associated with lower trabecular BMD at the radius (P = 0.03) and lower BMD z-score at the radius. level of the lumbar spine (P < 0.05). These results became more pronounced when the analysis was limited to non-Hispanic white patients. Of 13 documented fractures, 3 occurred after initiation of risperidone and SSRIs, and none occurred in patients with hyperprolactinemia. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first study to link risperidone-induced hyperprolactinemia to SSRI treatment to reduce BMD in children and adolescents. Future research should evaluate the longitudinal course of this adverse event to determine its temporal stability and whether a higher fracture rate follows.\n",
      "BACKGROUND: Generalized glucocorticoid resistance syndrome is a rare familial or sporadic disorder characterized by partial insensitivity to glucocorticoids, caused by mutations in the glucocorticoid receptor (GR) gene. Most reported cases involve adults with symptoms associated with excess mineralocorticoids and/or adrenal androgens caused by a compensatory increase in adrenocorticotropic hormone secretion. PATIENT: We have identified a new female case aged 2 years presenting a syndrome of generalized resistance to glucocorticoids. The patient (TJ) presented with a generalized seizure associated with hypoglycemia and hypokalemia. She also suffered from hypertension and premature pubarche, although dexamethasone effectively suppressed these clinical manifestations. RESULTS: The patient's GR gene had a heterozygous mutation (G-->A) at nucleotide position 2141 (exon 8), which resulted in the substitution of arginine for glutamine at amino acid position 714 in the ligand-binding domain (LBD) of GR alpha. Molecular analysis revealed that the mutant receptor had significantly impaired transactivation activity with a 2-fold reduction in ligand affinity. It showed attenuated transactivation of activation function (AF)-2 and reduced binding to a p160 nuclear receptor coactivator. Computerized structural analysis revealed that replacing arginine with glutamine at position 714 conveyed a conformational change to the LBD and AF-2 transactivation surface, resulting in a decrease in ligand and motif binding affinity. coactivator LXXLL. CONCLUSIONS: Dexamethasone treatment is effective in controlling premature pubarche, hypoglycemia, hypertension and hypokalemia in this pediatric case, in which arginine 714 plays a key role in proper pouch formation binding to the ligand and the AF-2 surface of GR alpha. LBD.\n",
      "BACKGROUND:The effects of 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin and related dioxin-like chemicals are mediated by binding-dependent activation of the cytosolic aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR). The human AHR is a low-affinity receptor compared to most rodents, but some reports suggest that there may be individuals with high-affinity polymorphic receptors, thus possibly increasing sensitivity to dioxins in these individuals. METHODS: Although no polymorphisms have been reported in the AHR ligand-binding region in over 100 reported sequences, we sequenced 108 additional human AHR genes in an effort to further identify polymorphisms unique single nucleotides (SNPs) in AHR open reading frames. Place of assisted procreation. DNA was sequenced from six ethnic populations including Japanese, Chinese, European/Caucasian, African American, Southeast Asian, and Hispanic. RESULTS: Six exonic SNPs were identified; four had been described as previously reported and two appear new. Four of the identified SNPs lead to amino acid changes in the AHR protein and two of the SNPs lead to synonymous substitutions. Four additional SNPs have been reported elsewhere and were not identified in the current analysis. With these new sequences, more than 200 human AHR gene sequences were analyzed for SNPs. CONCLUSION: The results indicate a very limited presence of polymorphisms in the core ligand binding region of the human AHR. Other regions, such as the transactivation domain, appear to be slightly more polymorphic in the human population and their impact on functionality should be examined in more detail.\n",
      "OBJECTIVES:People with both diabetes mellitus (DM) and the Haptoglobin (Hp) 2-2 genotype are at increased risk of cardiovascular disease. As the antioxidant function of the Hp 2-2 protein is impaired, we sought to test the pharmacogenomic hypothesis that supplementation with the antioxidant vitamin E would provide cardiovascular protection to individuals with Hp 2-2 DM. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We determined Hp genotype in participants with diabetes from two trials (HOPE and ICARE) and evaluated the effect of vitamin E by Hp genotype on their predefined common outcome, the composite of stroke, myocardial infarction and cardiovascular death. Data were analyzed with a fixed effects model. These results were introduced into a simulation model, Evidence Based Medicine Integrator, to estimate their long-term implications in a real population of Kaiser Permanente (CA, USA). RESULTS: Meta-analysis of both trials demonstrated a significant overall reduction in the composite endpoint in individuals with Hp 2-2 diabetes with vitamin E (odds ratio: 0.58; 95% CI: 0.40-0.86; p = 0.006). There was a statistically significant interaction between Hp genotype and vitamin E on the composite endpoint. In these trials, Hp typing of 69 people with diabetes and treating those with Hp 2-2 with vitamin E prevented myocardial infarction, stroke, or cardiovascular death. Lifelong administration of vitamin E to Hp 2-2 DM individuals in the Kaiser population would increase their life expectancy by 3 years. CONCLUSION:A pharmacogenomic strategy of screening individuals with diabetes for the Hp genotype and treating those with Hp 2-2 with vitamin E appears to be very clinically effective.\n",
      "An imbalance in skin wound repair can lead to continued ECM accumulation and excessive scar formation. In genetically predisposed susceptible individuals, keloid formation may be observed. Keloid disease represents a benign fibroproliferative cutaneous tumor unique to humans. TGF-beta is known to play a key role in the pathogenesis of this disease which is not yet fully understood. The TGF-beta1 and TGF-beta2 isoforms have profibrotic properties, while TGF-beta3 may have antifibrotic functions. TGF-beta exerts its influence by binding to TGF-beta type I and type II receptors, thereby forming a complex and activating specific downstream effector molecules. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of targeting TGF-beta1 by antisense oligonucleotides on RNA synthesis and protein expression of TGF-beta isoforms and their receptors in keloid-derived fibroblasts. . In tissue samples containing normal fibroblasts (NF) serving as control samples, the expression of TGF-beta1 and -beta2 was decreased compared to keloid fibroblasts (KF), while the expression of TGF-beta3 and of TGF-betaRII was significantly higher in NF. In ELISA, abrogation of TGF-beta1 resulted in a significant decrease in TGF-beta1 and -beta2 (p < 0.05). TGF-beta2 mRNA expression was reduced. TGF-beta3 mRNA expression revealed opposite trends in KFs from different patients, while TGF-betaRI expression was found to be equal during the measurement period. TGF-betaRII mRNA expression increased after 48 and 72 h, respectively. There is increasing evidence of a regulatory mechanism between TGF-beta1 and its receptors. Our results support this theory by suggesting interrelationships between the different TGF-beta isoforms and their receptors. An abnormal response of KFs to TGF-beta could reflect a modification of the regulatory pathway that occurs at the receptor level or during intracellular transduction. Improving the understanding of TGF-beta in keloid diseases could lead to the development of clinically useful therapeutic modalities for the treatment of keloid disease or even allow the identification of preventive strategies.\n",
      "BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Cerebral microbleeds (MBs) are potential risk factors for intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH), but it is unclear whether they constitute a contraindication to the use of antithrombotic medications. Insights could be obtained by pooling MB frequency data stratified by antithrombotic use in ICH and ischemic stroke (IS)/transient ischemic attack (TIA) cohorts. METHODS: We conducted a systematic review of published and unpublished data from cohorts with stroke or TIA to compare the presence of MB in: (1) antithrombotic users versus non-antithrombotic users with HIC; (2) antithrombotic users vs non-users with IS/TIA; and (3) ICH vs. ischemic events stratified by antithrombotic use. We also analyzed published and unpublished follow-up data to determine the risk of ICH in antithrombotic users with BD. RESULTS: In a pooled analysis of 1,460 ICH and 3,817 IS/TIAs, MBs were more common in ICH than in IS/TIAs in all treatment groups, but the excess increased by 2.8 (ratio odds; range 2.3-3.5) in non-antithrombotic users to 5.7 (range: 3.4-9.7) in users antiplatelet agents and 8.0 (range: 3.5-17.8) in warfarin users (P difference = 0.01). There was also excess MB in warfarin users compared with nonusers with ICH (OR, 2.7; 95% CI, 1.6-4.4; P < 0.001), but no in warfarin users with IS/TIA (OR, 1.3; 95% CI, 0.9). -1.7; P=0.33; Pdifference=0.01). There was a lower excess MB in antiplatelet users than in nonusers with ICH (OR, 1.7; 95% CI, 1.3-2.3; P<0.001), but results were similar for antiplatelet users with IS/TIA (OR, 1.4; 95% CI, 1.2-1.7; P < 0.001; difference P = 0.25). In pooled follow-up data for 768 antithrombotic users, the presence of MB at baseline was associated with a significantly increased risk of subsequent ICH (OR, 12.1; 95% CI, 3.4-42.5; P<0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Excess MB in warfarin users with ICH compared to other groups suggests that MB increases the risk of warfarin-associated ICH. Limited prospective data support these findings, but larger prospective studies are urgently needed.\n",
      "Different mechanisms have been suggested for cocaine toxicity, including increased oxidative stress, but the association between brain oxidative state and cocaine-induced behavior is poorly understood. Nuclear factor kappa B (NFkappaB) is a sensor of oxidative stress and participates in the formation of memory which could be involved in the mechanisms of toxicity and drug addiction. Therefore, NFkappaB activity, oxidative stress, neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS) activity, spatial learning and memory as well as the effect of topiramate, a previously proposed treatment for drug addiction cocaine, were evaluated in an experimental model of cocaine administration in rats. NFkappaB activity was decreased in the frontal cortex of cocaine-treated rats, as were GSH concentration and glutathione peroxidase activity in the hippocampus, while nNOS activity in the hippocampus was increased. . Memory retrieval of experiences acquired before cocaine administration was impaired and negatively correlated with NFkappaB activity in the frontal cortex. In contrast, learning of new tasks was enhanced and correlated with increased nNOS activity and decreased glutathione peroxidase. These results highlight a possible mechanistic role of oxidative and nitrosative stress and NFkappaB in cocaine-induced alterations. Topiramate prevented all observed alterations, demonstrating novel neuroprotective properties.\n",
      "The nephroprotective effect of coenzyme Q10 was studied in mice with acute kidney injury induced by a single i.p. injection. cisplatin injection (5 mg/kg). Coenzyme Q10 treatment (10 mg/kg/day, ip) was applied for 6 consecutive days, starting 1 day before cisplatin administration. Coenzyme Q10 significantly reduced blood urea nitrogen and serum creatinine levels, which were increased by cisplatin. Coenzyme Q10 significantly compensated for deficits in antioxidant defense mechanisms (reduction in glutathione level and superoxide dismutase activity), suppressed lipid peroxidation, decreased elevations in tumor necrosis factor alpha, nitric oxide and platinum ion concentration, and attenuated reductions in selenium and zinc ions. in renal tissue results from the administration of cisplatin. Furthermore, cisplatin-induced histopathological damage of renal tissue was ameliorated by coenzyme Q10 treatment. Immunohistochemical analysis revealed that coenzyme Q10 significantly decreased cisplatin-induced overexpression of inducible nitric oxide synthase, nuclear factor kappaB, caspase-3, and p53 in renal tissue. It was concluded that coenzyme Q10 represents a potential therapeutic option to protect against acute cisplatin nephrotoxicity commonly encountered in clinical practice.\n",
      "PURPOSE: Complement pathway genes, including complement factor H (CFH), C2/BF, and C3, have been reported to be associated with age-related macular degeneration (AMD). The genetic variants, single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), of these genes were genotyped for a case-control association study in a Han Chinese mainland population. METHODS:One hundred and fifty-eight wet AMD patients, 80 soft drusen patients, and 220 matched control subjects were recruited from Han Chinese in mainland China. Seven SNPs in CFH and two SNPs in C2, CFB' and C3 were genotyped using the ABI SNaPshot method. A deletion of 84,682 base pairs spanning the CFHR1 and CFHR3 genes was detected by direct polymerase chain reaction and gel electrophoresis. RESULTS: Four SNPs, including rs3753394 (P = 0.0276), rs800292 (P = 0.0266), rs1061170 (P = 0.00514), and rs1329428 (P = 0.0089), in CFH showed a significant association with wet AMD in the cohort of this study. . A haplotype containing these four SNPs (CATA) significantly increased protection against wet AMD with a P value of 0.0005 and an odds ratio of 0.29 (95% confidence interval: 0.15-0.60) . Unlike other populations, rs2274700 and rs1410996 did not show a significant association with AMD in the Chinese population of this study. None of the CFH SNPs showed a significant association with drusen, and none of the CFH, C2, CFB, and C3 SNPs showed a significant association with wet AMD or drusen in this study cohort . CFHR1 and CFHR3 deletion was not polymorphic in the Chinese population and was not associated with wet AMD or drusen. CONCLUSION: This study showed that SNPs rs3753394 (P = 0.0276), rs800292 (P = 0.0266), rs1061170 (P = 0.00514) and rs1329428 (P = 0.0089), but not rs7535263, rs1410996 or rs22747. 00, in CFH were significantly associated with wet AMD in a mainland Han Chinese population. This study showed that CFH was more likely to be an AMD susceptibility gene at Chr.1q31, based on the finding that deletion of CFHR1 and CFHR3 was not polymorphic in this study cohort , and none of the SNPs significantly associated with AMD in a white population in the C2, CFB and C3 genes showed a significant association with AMD.\n",
      "BACKGROUND: Prohormone convertase 1 is involved in peptide processing. Rare mutations in the PCSK1 gene, encoding this enzyme, cause childhood obesity and abnormal glucose homeostasis with elevated proinsulin concentrations. Common single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) within this gene, rs6232 and rs6235, are associated with obesity. We investigated whether these SNPs influence prediabetic traits of insulin resistance, beta cell dysfunction, or glucose intolerance. METHODS: We genotyped 1,498 German subjects for SNPs rs6232 and rs6235 within PCSK1. Subjects were characterized metabolically by an oral glucose tolerance test with measurements of glucose, insulin, proinsulin, and C-peptide. A subgroup of 512 subjects underwent a hyperinsulinaemic-euglycemic clamp. RESULTS: Minor allele frequencies were 25.8% for SNP rs6235 and 6.0% for rs6232. After adjusting for sex and age, we found no association between SNPs rs6235 and rs6232 with BMI or other weight-related traits (all p > or = 0.07). Both minor alleles, adjusted for sex, age, BMI and insulin sensitivity, were associated with elevated AUCproinsulin and AUCproinsulin/AUCinsulin (rs6235: p (additive) model < or = 0.009, effect sizes 8/8%, rs6232: dominant pmodel < or = 0.01, effect sizes 10/21%). Insulin secretion was not affected by the variants (different secretion parameters, all p > or = 0.08). The minor allele of the rs6232 SNP was further associated with 15% higher OGTT-derived insulin sensitivity and 19% higher clamp-derived insulin sensitivity (pdom < or= 0.0047 ), 4.5% lower blood glucose than HOMAIR (pdom = 0.02) and 3.5% lower 120-minute blood glucose. (pdom = 0.0003) independent of BMI and proinsulin conversion. SNP rs6235 was not associated with glucose metabolism parameters. CONCLUSIONS: Like rare PCSK1 mutations, the most common variants tested determine glucose-stimulated proinsulin conversion, but not insulin secretion. Additionally, rs6232, encoding the N221D amino acid exchange, influences insulin sensitivity and glucose homeostasis.\n",
      "BACKGROUND:Patients with TSH beta subunit abnormalities and congenital hypothyroidism are not considered in TSH-based newborn screening. OBJECTIVE: Our objective was to report the molecular consequences of a novel splice-junction mutation and a novel missense mutation in the TSH-beta subunit gene found in two patients with congenital central hypothyroidism and d Conventional anemia resistant to treatment. RESULTS: Patient 1 had a homozygous G to A nucleotide change at the 5' donor splice site of exon/intron 2. This resulted in a silent change at codon 34 of the mature protein. In vitro splicing assays showed that the mutant minigene significantly affected pre-mRNA processing, causing the complete omission of exon 2. The putative product arose from a novel out-of-frame translation start point in the Exon 3 should produce a nonsense peptide of 25 amino acids. In patient 2, sequence analysis revealed compound heterozygosity for the previously reported 313delT (C105Vfs114X) mutation and for a second novel mutation in exon 3, substituting G for A at position 323 of the cDNA nucleotide, resulting in a change to C88Y. This cysteine ​​residue is conserved among all dimeric beta subunits of pituitary and placental glycoprotein hormone. Data from in silico analysis confirmed that the C88Y mutation would affect subunit conformation. Indeed, two different bioinformatics approaches, PolyPhen and SIFT analysis, predicted that C88Y would be a damaging substitution. CONCLUSIONS: In case of isolated TSH deficiency, exact molecular diagnosis is mandatory for the diagnosis of isolated pituitary deficiency, definition of prognosis and genetic counseling. In addition, the diagnosis of central hypothyroidism must be considered in the face of severe childhood anemia of uncertain etiology.\n",
      "BACKGROUND:The phosphodiesterase 4D (PDE4D) gene has been reported as a stroke susceptibility gene. The genetic effect could be attributed to its role in modulating the atherogenic process in the carotid arteries. Using carotid intima-media thickness (IMT) and plaque index as phenotypes, the present study sought to determine the influence of this gene on subclinical atherosclerosis. METHODS:Carotid ultrasound was performed on 1,013 stroke-free subjects who participated in medical screening programs (age 52.6 +/- 12.2; 47.6% male). The distribution of genotypes was compared between high-risk (plaque index > or = 4), low-risk (index = 1-3), and reference (index = 0) groups. We analyzed continuous IMT data and dichotomized IMT data using the mean plus one standard deviation as the cutoff level. Since plaque prevalence and IMT values ​​showed a notable difference between men and women, we performed sex-specific analyzes in addition to the overall data analysis. Rs702553 at the PDE4D gene was selected because it conferred risk of stroke in young people in our previous report. Previous data on young stroke patients (190 cases and 211 controls) with an additional 532 control subjects without ultrasound data were presented as cross-validation of the genetic effect. RESULTS: In overall analyses, the rare homozygous rs702553 led to an OR of 3.1 (p = 0.034) for a plaque index > or = 4. When subjects were stratified by sex, the genetic effect was not evident only in men but not in men. women. Comparing male subjects with plaque index > or = 4 and those with plaque index = 0, the TT genotype was overrepresented (27.6% versus 13.4%, p = 0.008). For dichotomized IMT data in males, the TT genotype had an OR of 2.1 (p = 0.032) for thicker IMT at the common carotid artery compared to the (AA + AT) genotypes. In women, neither IMT nor plaque index was associated with rs702553. Similarly, the SNP rs702553 was only significant in young men with stroke (OR = 1.8, p = 0.025), but not in women (p = 0.27). CONCLUSIONS:The present study demonstrates a sex differential effect of PDE4D on IMT, plaque index and stroke, highlighting its influence on various aspects of atherogenesis.\n",
      "The inferior colliculus (IC) is primarily involved in processing auditory information, but it is distinguished from other auditory nuclei of the brainstem by its connections with structures of the motor system. Functional evidence linking the IC to motor behavior comes from experiments showing that activation of the IC by electrical stimulation or microinjection of excitatory amino acids causes freezing, escape behavior, and immobility. However, the nature of this immobility still remains unclear. The present study examined the influence of excitatory amino acid-mediated mechanisms in IC on catalepsy induced by haloperidol, a dopamine receptor blocker, administered systemically (1 or 0.5 mg/kg) in the rat. Haloperidol-induced catalepsy was induced by prior intracollicular microinjections of NMDA glutamate receptor antagonists MK-801 (15 or 30 mmol/0.5 microl) and AP7 (10 or 20 nmol/0.5 microl ), or the NMDA receptor agonist N-methyl- d-aspartate (NMDA, 20 or 30 nmol/0.5 microl). Results showed that intracollicular microinjection of MK-801 and AP7 preceding systemic haloperidol injections significantly attenuated catalepsy, as indicated by reduced latency to descend from a horizontal bar. Accordingly, intracollicular microinjection of NMDA increased the latency time required to lower the bar. These results suggest that glutamate-mediated mechanisms in neuronal circuits at the IC level influence haloperidol-induced catalepsy and participate in the regulation of motor activity.\n",
      "The phenotypic presentation of 46,XY DSD depends on the underlying defects. A lack of action of androgens on target tissues or production of an active metabolite share common morphological characteristics. A molecular study can help differentiate these abnormalities accurately. Mutational analysis of the androgen receptor (AR) and SRD5A2 genes was performed in 29 patients with 46,XY DSD, by PCR-SSCP. Amplicons showing aberrant migration in SSCP were subjected to sequencing. Interestingly, six patients from 4 unrelated families (a sibling pair, an uncle/nephew and two others isolated) were identified with mutations in the SRD5A2 gene. In five patients, a p.R246Q missense mutation was detected, four of which were homozygous and one compound heterozygous: g.80_87delT CGCGAAG (p.A27fsX132) and p.R246Q. Another patient with isolated micropenis had a heterozygous missense mutation p.G196S. No AR gene mutations were detected. In conclusion, our study suggests that p.R246Q mutation is common in patients with SRD5A2 gene defect in the northern states of India. In addition, he recorded a new deletion in exon 1 of the SRD5A2 gene in a patient suffering from severe hypospadias.\n",
      "BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES: It is still unclear what happens in the glomerulus when proteinuria begins. Using puromycin aminonucleoside nephrosis (PAN) rats, we studied early changes in ultrastructure and permeability in relation to the expression of podocyte-associated molecules nephrin, a-actinin, dendrin and plekhh2, the last two of which have only recently been discovered in podocytes. METHODS: Using immune stains, semi-quantitative measurements were performed using an electron microscope. Patency was assessed using isolated renal perfusion with tracers. The possible effects of ACE inhibition were tested. RESULTS: On day 2, some patchy effacement of the foot processes, but no proteinuria, appeared. The amount of nephrin was reduced in diseased and normal areas. Other proteins showed few changes, limited to diseased areas. By day 4, effacement of the foot processes was complete and proteinuria appeared alongside signs of waist barrier damage. Nephrin decreased further, while dendrin and plekhh2 also decreased, but a-actinin remained unchanged. ACE inhibition had no significant protective effect. CONCLUSIONS: PAN glomeruli already showed significant pathology on day 4, despite relatively mild proteinuria. This was preceded by altered nephrin expression, confirming its central role in podocyte morphology. The novel proteins dendrin and plekhh2 were both reduced, suggesting a role in PAN, whereas a-actinin was unchanged.\n",
      "BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES: GH insensitivity and IGF deficiency may result from GH receptor (GHR) aberrations. We describe a 4-year-old child with modest growth retardation and normal serum concentrations of GH-binding protein (GHBP) but clinical evidence of GH unresponsiveness. METHOD: Serum and DNA samples from the proband and his parents were analyzed. RESULTS: The child had a height of -4 SD, elevated serum GH concentrations, abnormally low serum IGF-I and IGFBP-3 concentrations, and normal GHBP concentrations. DNA analysis revealed compound heterozygosity for GHR mutations, including a previously reported R211H mutation and a novel single nucleotide duplication in exon 9 (899dupC), the latter resulting in a frameshift of reading and a premature stop codon. Treatment with recombinant DNA-derived IGF-I resulted in accelerated growth. CONCLUSION:Mutations affecting the intracellular domain of GHR can lead to GH insensitivity and IGF deficiency, despite normal serum GHBP concentrations. The presence of clinical and biochemical evidence of GH resistance is sufficient to consider the possibility of GHR aberrations, even in the presence of normal serum GHBP concentrations.\n",
      "OBJECTIVE: This study was designed to establish a rat model of thoracic aortic aneurysm (TAA) by calcium chloride (CaCl(2))-induced arterial injury and to explore the potential role of a disintegrin and a metalloproteinase (ADAM), matrix metalloproteinases (MMP). ) and their endogenous inhibitors (TIMP) in the formation of TAA. METHODS: The thoracic aorta of male Sprague-Dawley rats was exposed to 0.5 M CaCl(2) or normal saline (NaCl). After 12 weeks, animals were euthanized and CaCl(2)-treated, non-CaCl(2)-treated (n = 12), and NaCl-treated (n = 12) aortic segments were collected for histological and molecular evaluations. . MMP-TIMP and ADAM mRNAs were analyzed semi-quantitatively, and protein expressions were determined by immunohistochemistry. RESULTS: Despite similar external diameters between CaCl(2)-treated, non-CaCl(2)-treated, and NaCl-treated segments, aneurymal alteration (n = 6, 50%), media degeneration with regional disruption, elastic fiber fragmentation, and increased collagen deposition (n = 12, 100%) were demonstrated in CaCl(2)-treated segments. MMP-2, MMP-9, ADAM-10, and ADAM-17 mRNA levels increased in CaCl(2)-treated segments (all p < 0.01), with trends toward elevation in segments not treated with CaCl(2), compared to Segments treated with NaCl. Immunohistochemistry showed a significant increase in the expressions of MMP-2, MMP-9, ADAM-10 and ADAM-17 (all p < 0.01) in the intima and press for CaCl(2)-treated segments. . TIMP mRNA and tissue levels did not differ obviously between the three aortic segments. CONCLUSION: This study establishes a TAA model by periarterial exposure to CaCl(2) in rats and demonstrates a significant elevation in the expression of MMP-2, MMP-9, ADAM10 and ADAM17 in the pathogenesis of vascular remodeling.\n",
      "OBJECTIVE:The present study aimed to estimate the association between migraine susceptibility and 12-nucleotide insertion/deletion (indel) polymorphism in the promoter region of the alpha(2B)-adrenergic receptor (ADRA2B) gene. METHODS:A case-control study was performed in the Han Chinese population, including 368 migraine cases and 517 controls. Genomic DNA was extracted from blood samples and DNA fragments containing the site of the polymorphism were amplified by PCR. Data were adjusted for sex, age, migraine history, and family history, and analyzed using a logistic regression model. RESULTS: There was no association between indel polymorphism and migraine at either the allele or genotype level. CONCLUSION: These results do not support a functional significance of the ADRA2B indel polymorphism at position -4825 relative to the start codon in the most upstream region of the promoter in current migraine subjects.\n",
      "PURPOSE:The C-C chemokine receptor 5 (CCR5) plays an important role in inflammation. A deletion of 32 base pairs (DD32) in the CCR5 gene leads to a nonfunctional receptor. This suppression has been reported to have a protective effect on the development and progression of several autoimmune diseases. We investigated whether DD32 deletion was associated with disease susceptibility in a population of patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA), systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), and lupus nephritis (LN); and whether this is associated with disease severity. METHODS: DNA samples from 405 RA patients, 97 SLE patients, 113 LN patients and 431 healthy controls were genotyped for CCR5 DD32 deletion. Differences in genotype frequencies were tested between patients and controls. The association of genotypes with disease severity was analyzed. RESULTS: The genotype frequencies of each group were in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium. Genotype frequencies of patients did not differ significantly from those of controls (CCR5/DD32, DD32/DD32: PR 18.3% and 1.2%, respectively; SLE 17.5% and 2.1%; LN 13.3 % and 1.8%; controls 20.0% and 2.8%). However, there was a trend toward a lower frequency of DD32 deletion alleles in LN patients compared to controls (p = 0.08). There was no significant association between CCR5 status and disease severity in RA, SLE, or LN. CONCLUSION: Although an association with LN cannot be excluded, CCR5 DD32 deletion does not appear to be a disease susceptibility genotype for RA, SLE, or LN. No significant effect of DD32 deletion on disease severity was demonstrated.\n",
      "BACKGROUND: Impaired serotonergic neuronal transmission is hypothesized to be a susceptibility factor to psychotic disorders such as schizophrenia. The serotonin 6 (5-HT6) receptor is therapeutically targeted by several second-generation antipsychotics, such as clozapine and olanzapine, and d-amphetamine-induced hyperactivity in rats is corrected by the use of 'a selective antagonist of 5-HT6 receptors. Furthermore, disrupted prepulse inhibition induced by d-amphetamine or phencyclidine was restored by a 5-HT6 receptor antagonist in an animal study using rats. These animal models have been considered to reflect the positive symptoms of schizophrenia, and the above evidence suggests that altered 5-HT6 receptors are involved in the pathophysiology of psychotic disorders. The symptoms of methamphetamine (METH)-induced psychosis are similar to those of paranoid-type schizophrenia. Therefore, we performed an analysis of the association of 5-HT6 (HTR6) gene with METH-induced psychosis. METHOD: Using five tagging SNPs (rs6693503, rs1805054, rs4912138, rs3790757, and rs9659997), we performed genetic association analysis of case-control samples (197 patients with METH-induced psychosis and 337 controls) in the Japanese population. The age and gender of the control subjects did not differ from those of the methamphetamine-dependent patients. RESULTS: rs6693503 was associated with METH-induced psychosis patients in allele/genotype analysis. Furthermore, this association remained significant after Bonferroni correction. In haplotype analysis, we detected an association between two markers (rs6693503 and rs1805054) and three markers (rs6693503, rs1805054 and rs4912138) in patients with HTR6- and METH-induced psychosis, respectively. CONCLUSION:HTR6 may play an important role in the pathophysiology of METH-induced psychosis in the Japanese population.\n",
      "OBJECTIVES: Hypertension often persists after adrenalectomy for primary aldosteronism. Traditional factors associated with postoperative hypertension have been evaluated, but whether genetic determinants were involved remains poorly understood. The aim of this study was to investigate the association of DNA polymorphisms within steroid synthesis genes (CYP11B2, CYP11B1) and postoperative resolution of hypertension in Chinese patients undergoing adrenalectomy for producing adenomas. aldosterone (APA). METHODS:Ninety-three patients with APA were evaluated for postoperative resolution of hypertension. All patients were genotyped for rs1799998 (C-344 T), intron 2 conversion, rs4539 (A2718G) in CYP11B2 and rs6410 (G22 5A), rs6387 (A2803G) in CYP11B1. Associations between CYPB11B2/CYP11B1 polymorphisms and persistent postoperative hypertension were evaluated by multivariate analysis. RESULTS:The CYP11B2-CYP11B1 haplotype was associated with persistent postoperative hypertension in Chinese patients undergoing adrenalectomy with APA (P = 0.006). Specifically, the rs4539 (AA) polymorphism was associated with persistent postoperative hypertension (P = 0.002). Multivariate logistic regression revealed that common haplotypes H1 (AGACT), H2 (AGAWT), and H3 (AGAWC) were associated with persistent postoperative hypertension (P = 0.01, 0.03, 0.005 after Bonferroni correction). Other predictors of persistent postoperative hypertension included duration of hypertension (P < 0.0005), family history of hypertension (P = 0.001), and elevated systolic blood pressure (P = 0.015). CONCLUSIONS: rs4539 (AA), H1, H2 and H3 are genetic predictors of postoperative persistence of hypertension in Chinese patients treated with adrenalectomy with APA. DNA polymorphisms at the CYP11B2/B1 locus may confer susceptibility to postoperative hypertension in patients with APA.\n",
      "The conversion of fibrinogen to fibrin plays an essential role in hemostasis and results in the stabilization of the fibrin clot. Fibrinogen consists of three pairs of non-identical polypeptide chains, encoded by different genes (fibrinogen alpha [FGA], fibrinogen beta [FGB], and fibrinogen gamma [FGG]). A functional single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in the 3' untranslated region of the FGG gene (FGG 10034C>T, rs2066865) has been associated with deep vein thrombosis and myocardial infarction. The aim of the present study was to analyze the role of this polymorphism in peripheral arterial disease (PAD). The study was designed as a case-control study including 891 patients with documented PAD and 777 control subjects. FGG genotypes were determined by exonuclease (TaqMan) assays. The frequencies of FGG genotypes were not significantly different between PAD patients (CC: 57.3%, CT: 36.7%, TT: 5.8%) and control subjects (CC: 60.9%, CT : 33.5%, TT 5.6%; p = 0.35). In a multivariate logistic regression analysis including age, sex, smoking, diabetes, high blood pressure and high cholesterol, the FGG 10034 T variant was not significantly associated with the presence of PAD (odds ratio 1.07, 95% confidence interval 0.84 - 1.37; p = 0.60). ). The FGG 10034C>T polymorphism was also not associated with age of onset of PAD. We conclude that the FGG 10034 T thrombophilic gene variant does not contribute to genetic susceptibility to PAD.\n",
      "IMPORTANCE OF THE AREA: Fluoropyrimidines, particularly 5-fluorouracil (5-FU), have been the mainstay of treatment for several solid tumors, including colorectal, breast, and head and neck cancers, for >40 years. AREAS COVERED IN THIS REVIEW: This article reviews the pharmacology and effectiveness of capecitabine with particular emphasis on its safety. WHAT THE READER WILL GAIN: The reader will gain greater insight into the safety of capecitabine in special populations such as elderly and patients with kidney disease. We are also exploring different dosages and administration schedules of capecitabine. TAKEAWAY MESSAGE: Capecitabine is an oral prodrug of 5-FU and was developed to address the need for more convenient therapy and provide an improved safety/effectiveness profile. It has shown promising results, alone or in combination with other chemotherapeutic agents, in colorectal, breast, pancreaticobiliary, gastric, renal, and head and neck cancers. The most commonly reported toxic effects of capecitabine are diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, stomatitis, and hand-foot syndrome. Capecitabine has a well-established safety profile and can be safely administered to patients with advanced age and hepatic and renal dysfunction.\n",
      "This study investigated the possible association between three functional polymorphisms in the promoter region of the dopamine D4 receptor (DRD4) gene and schizophrenia, depression and heroin dependence. Genomic DNA was isolated from venous blood leukocytes of 322 unrelated patients with schizophrenia, 156 patients with depression, 300 patients with heroin addiction, and 300 healthy unrelated individuals. Polymorphisms in the DRD4 promoter region (-120 bp duplication, -616C/G, and -521C/T) were genotyped using allele-specific polymerase chain reaction analysis. Genotype and allele were analyzed using SPSS 11.5 software. The results of this analysis indicated that there is a strong finding of duplication allele frequencies of -120 bp with schizophrenia (p = 0.008) and a weak finding of -1240 L/S and for paranoid schizophrenia (p = 0.022). Interestingly, there is a stronger result with C/T allele frequencies of -521 with heroin dependence (p = 0.0002). These observations strongly suggest that the -120 bp duplication polymorphism of DRD4 is associated with schizophrenia and that the -521 C/T polymorphism is associated with heroin dependence.\n",
      "CONTEXT _#38; OBJECTIVES:Aceruloplasminemia is a rare autosomal recessive neurodegenerative disease associated with iron accumulation in the brain and liver that typically manifests as movement disorders, retinal degeneration, and diabetes mellitus. Ceruloplasmin is a multi-copper ferroxidase that is secreted into plasma and facilitates cellular iron export and iron binding to transferrin. RESULTS: A novel homozygous mutation in the ceruloplasmin gene, c.2554+1G>T, was identified as the cause of aceruloplasminemia in three affected siblings. Two siblings had movement disorders and diabetes. Further DNA sequencing showed that this mutation causes skipping of exon 14 and deletion of amino acids 809-852 while preserving the open reading frame. Western blotting of liver extracts and sera from affected patients showed retention of the abnormal protein in the liver. Aceruloplasminemia was associated with severe iron overload of the brain and liver, where hepatic mRNA expression of the iron hormone hepcidin was increased, corresponding to the degree of iron overload. Hepatic iron concentration normalized after 3 and 5 months of iron chelation treatment with deferasirox, which was also associated with a reduction in insulin demand. During short-term treatment, there was no clinical or imaging evidence of significant effects on cerebral iron overload. CONCLUSIONS: Aceruloplasminemia may have incomplete clinical penetrance but is invariably associated with iron accumulation in the liver and brain. Iron accumulation in aceruloplasminemia is the result of defective cellular iron export, where hepcidin regulation is adapted to the degree of iron overload. Iron chelation with deferasirox has been shown to be effective in mobilizing hepatic iron but has no effect on brain iron.\n",
      "Mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) is a rare and aggressive type of B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma. Patients gradually become refractory to conventional chemotherapy and have a poor prognosis. However, a remission rate of 38% was recently reported in refractory MCL treated with temsirolimus, an mTOR inhibitor. Here, we had the opportunity to study a case of refractory MCL that showed tumor regression two months after temsirolimus treatment, and progression-free survival. of 10 months. In this case, lymph node biopsies were taken before and six months after treatment with temsirolimus. Comparison of the two biopsies showed that temsirolimus inhibited tumor cell proliferation through cell cycle arrest, but induced no change in the number of apoptotic tumor cells. In addition to this cytostatic effect, temsirolimus had an antiangiogenic effect with a reduction in the density of tumor microvessels and the expression of VEGF. Additionally, numerous patchy and well-demarcated fibrous areas, consistent with post-necrotic tissue repair, were found after 6 months of temsirolimus treatment. Thus, temsirolimus reduced tumor burden through associated cytostatic and anti-angiogenic effects. This dual effect of temsirolimus on tumor tissue could contribute to its recently reported efficacy in refractory MCL resistant to conventional chemotherapy.\n",
      "BACKGROUND:Keratitis-ichthyosis-deafness (KID) syndrome is a rare congenital ectodermal disease caused by a heterozygous missense mutation of GJB2, encoding the gap junction protein connexin 26. The most common mutation is the p.Asp50Asn mutation, and only a few other mutations. have been described to date. OBJECTIVE:To report the fatal clinical course and characterize the genetic background of a premature male neonate with clinical and histological features of KID syndrome. METHODS: Genomic DNA was extracted from peripheral blood and used for PCR amplification of the GJB2 gene. Direct sequencing was used for mutation analysis. RESULTS: Clinical features included hearing impairment, ichthyosiform erythroderma with hyperkeratotic plaques, palmoplantar keratoderma, scalp and eyelash alopecia, and thick vernix caseosa-like scalp coverage. During histological analysis, characteristic features of KID syndrome, such as acanthosis and papillomatosis of the epidermis with basketry hyperkeratosis, were observed. Cutaneous symptoms were successfully treated with acitretin 0.5 mg/kg. The boy developed intraventricular and intracerebral hemorrhage, leading to hydrocephalus. His condition was further complicated by sepsis and meningitis caused by infection with Klebsiella pneumoniae, a producer of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase. Severe respiratory failure followed and the child died at 46 weeks gestational age (13 weeks after birth). Sequencing of the GJB2 gene showed that the child was heterozygous for a novel nucleotide change, c.263C>T, in exon 2, leading to an alanine to valine substitution at position 88 (p.Ala88Val ). CONCLUSIONS: This study identified a novel de novo heterozygous mutation in the Cx26 gene (c.263C>T; p.Ala88Val) leading to KID syndrome.\n",
      "BACKGROUND:Mal de Meleda (MDM) is an autosomal recessive palmoplantar erythrokeratoderma and is caused by a mutation in the gene encoding SLURP-1 (lymphocyte antigen 6/urokinase-type plasminogen activator receptor-related protein 1). SLURP-1 is an allosteric agonist of the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAchR) and regulates epidermal homeostasis. Additionally, murine studies have shown that nAchR signaling is important for the regulation of T cell function. Among family members, patients with the homozygous SLURP1 mutation (formerly known as component B of the 'ARS) are prone to melanoma and viral infection, which could be linked to defective functioning of T lymphocytes as well as a disorder of epidermal homeostasis. OBJECTIVES: To study the association of SLURP1 gene mutation with T cell activation in a Taiwanese family with MDM. To test that SLURP-1 is essential for T cell activation. METHODS: Human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were isolated from a Taiwanese MDM family carrying the G to A substitution in nucleotide 256 of the SLURP1 gene, corresponding to a glycine to arginine substitution at amino acid 86 (G86R) in SLURP-1. protein. PBMCs from homozygotes and wild-type controls were stimulated with anti-CD3/anti-CD28 antibodies and the level of T cell activation was determined by the stimulation index. RESULTS: PBMCs with heterozygous and homozygous SLURP-1 G86R mutation exhibited defective T cell activation. This was restored by the addition of 0.5 µg mL(-1) of recombinant human SLURP-1 protein. CONCLUSIONS: MDM patients carrying the homozygous SLURP-1 G86R mutation may exhibit impaired T cell activation. The presence of wild-type SLURP-1 is essential for normal T cell activation.\n",
      "A 76-year-old woman with a history of coronary artery bypass grafting and myocardial infarction was transferred to the emergency room with loss of consciousness due to marked bradycardia caused by hyperkalemia. The serum potassium concentration was elevated and normal sinus rhythm was restored after correction of the serum potassium level. The cause of hyperkalemia was considered to be multiple doses of spiranolactone, an aldosterone antagonist, in addition to long-term use of ramipril, an ACE inhibitor. This case is a good example of electrolyte imbalance causing life-threatening acute cardiac events. Clinicians should be alert to the possibility of hyperkalemia, particularly in elderly patients using ACE/ARB in combination with potassium-sparing agents who have mild renal dysfunction.\n",
      "Approximately 30% of alleles causing genetic disorders generate premature termination codons (PTCs), generally associated with severe phenotypes. However, bypassing the deleterious stop codon can lead to a benign course of the disease. Splicing at NAGNAG tandem splice sites has been reported to result in the insertion or deletion (indel) of three nucleotides. We identified such a mechanism as being responsible for the mild to asymptomatic phenotype observed in CF patients homozygous for the E831X (2623G>T) mutation in the CFTR gene. Analyzes performed on nasal epithelial cell mRNA detected three distinct isoforms, a situation considerably more complex than expected for a single nucleotide substitution. Structure-function studies and in silico analyzes provided the first experimental evidence of a stop codon indel by alternative splicing at a NAGNAG acceptor site. In addition to contributing to proteome plasticity, alternative splicing at a NAGNAG tandem site can thus eliminate a pathogenic UAG stop codon. This molecular study reveals a natural mechanism in which the effect of modifying genes or epigenetic factors could be suspected. This finding is important for genetic counseling as well as for deciding appropriate therapeutic strategies.\n",
      "OBJECTIVE: To report a case of methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA) bacteremia with suspected MSSA meningitis treated with high-dose daptomycin, evaluated with concomitant serum and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) concentrations. CASE SUMMARY: A 54-year-old man presented to the emergency department with generalized weakness and presumed nosocomial pneumonia, visible on a chest x-ray. Treatment was initiated empirically with vancomycin, levofloxacin, and piperacillin/tazobactam. Blood cultures revealed S. aureus susceptible to oxacillin. Empirical antibiotic treatment was limited to nafcillin on day 4. On day 8, the patient developed acute renal failure (serum creatinine 1.9 mg/dL, increased from 1.2 mg/dL the day before and 0, 8 mg/dL on admission). The patient's Glasgow score was 3, with normal findings shown on head CT scan 72 hours after an episode of cardiac arrest on day 10. The patient experienced recurrent MSSA bacteremia on day 9, increasing the suspicion of a central nervous system (CNS). Nafcillin was discontinued and daptomycin 9 mg/kg per day was initiated for suspected meningitis and continued until the patient died on day 16. The trough concentrations of daptomycin in serum and in CSF were 11.21 ug/mL and 0.52 ug/mL, respectively, before the third dose. . The lumbar puncture results were inconclusive and no further blood cultures were positive for MSSA. Creatine kinase levels were normal before daptomycin treatment and were not reassessed. DISCUSSION: Daptomycin was initiated in our patient following possible nafcillin-induced acute interstitial nephritis and recurrent bacteremia. At a dose of 9 mg/kg, the resulting penetration of 5% was higher than in previous reports, more consistent with inflammation of the meninges. CONCLUSIONS: High-dose daptomycin may be an alternative option for MSSA bacteremia with or without a CNS source in patients who have failed or cannot tolerate standard therapy. Further clinical evaluation in patients with confirmed meningitis is warranted.\n",
      "The in vivo characterization of a dual adenosine A(2A)/A(1) receptor antagonist in several animal models of Parkinson's disease is described. The discovery and scale-up syntheses of compound 1 are described in detail, highlighting optimization steps that increased the overall yield of 1 from 10.0% to 30.5%. Compound 1 is a potent A(2A)/A(1) receptor antagonist in vitro (A(2A) K(i) = 4.1 nM; A(1) K(i) = 17.0 nM) which exhibits excellent activity after oral administration. administration, in a number of animal models of Parkinson's disease, including mouse and rat models of haloperidol-induced catalepsy, a mouse model of reserpine-induced akinesia, 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) rat model of drug-induced rotation injury and MPTP-treated non-human primate model.\n",
      "Primary glucocorticoid resistance (OMIM 138040) is a rare inherited disease that causes generalized partial insensitivity to the action of glucocorticoids, due to genetic alterations of the glucocorticoid receptor (GR). The investigation of adrenal incidentalomas led to the discovery of a family (eight affected individuals spread over three generations), prone to cortisol resistance, bilateral adrenal hyperplasia, arterial hypertension and hypokalemia. This phenotype, exacerbated over time, co-segregates with the first heterozygous nonsense mutation p.R469[R,X] reported to date for GR, replacing an arginine (CGA) with a stop (TGA) at the amino acid 469 in the second zinc finger. of the DNA binding domain of the receptor. In vitro, this mutation leads to a truncated 50 kDa GR lacking hormone and DNA binding capacity, lacking hormone-dependent nuclear translocation and transactivation properties. In the proband's fibroblasts, we demonstrated the lack of expression of the defective allele in vivo. The absence of detectable mutated GR mRNA was accompanied by a 50% reduction in wild-type GR transcript and proteins. This reduced GR expression leads to significantly lower than normal induction of the glucocorticoid-induced target genes, FKBP5, in fibroblasts. We demonstrated that the molecular mechanisms of glucocorticoid signaling dysfunction involve GR haploinsufficiency due to selective degradation of the mutated GR transcript by nonsense-mediated mRNA degradation that was experimentally validated in fibroblasts. of propositions treated with emetine. GR haploinsufficiency leads to hypertension due to illicit occupancy of the renal mineralocorticoid receptor by elevated cortisol rather than increased mineralocorticoid production reported in primary glucocorticoid resistance. Indeed, an apparent mineralocorticoid excess was demonstrated by a decreased urinary tetrahydrocortisone-tetrahydrocortisol ratio in affected patients, revealing reduced glucocorticoid degradation through renal 11b-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 2 activity, a gene regulated by GR. We thus propose that GR haploinsufficiency compromises sensitivity to glucocorticoids and may represent a new genetic cause of subclinical hypercortisolism, revealed elsewhere in bilateral adrenal hyperplasia and hypertension independent of mineralocorticoids.\n",
      "WHAT IS KNOWN AND PURPOSE: CYP2C8 is involved in the cytochrome P450 (CYP) epoxygenase pathway. Metabolites of arachidonic acid, such as epoxyeicosatrienoic acids and hydroxyeicosatetrenoic acids, may play a role in hypertension. Our goal was to develop a medium-throughput method to screen samples for known and novel CYP2C8 mutations using denaturing high-performance liquid chromatography (DHPLC). METHODS: DNA samples from 200 subjects (hypertensive patients and healthy controls) were screened for CYP2C8 SNPs by DHPLC. The CYP2C8 genotypes and allele frequencies between healthy controls and patients with hypertension were compared. RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONS: Six variants were detected and two were novel; Deletion of T at 5063 and substitution of C for T at 33468 in exon 8. Variable frequency differences were detected between controls and hypertensive patients. Controls have a significantly higher prevalence of C35322C compared to patients. The functional significance of the SNP at 35322 requires further study. Having a homozygous C35322C could be a protective factor against hypertension. WHAT'S NEW AND CONCLUSION: Denaturing high-performance liquid chromatography is useful for population screening to identify new and existing SNPs. A higher frequency of the C35322T SNP was observed in hypertensive patients compared to control subjects. This potentially important observation must be confirmed and its clinical significance assessed.\n",
      "BACKGROUND:Loss of noradrenergic neurons in the locus coeruleus is a major hallmark of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Dopamine b-hydroxylase (DBH) catalyzes the conversion of dopamine to norepinephrine. Interactions have been reported between the low-activity -1021T (rs1611115) allele of DBH and polymorphisms in the pro-inflammatory cytokine genes, IL1A and IL6, contributing to AD risk. We therefore examined the associations with AD of the DBH -1021T allele and the above interactions in the Epistasis Project, with 1,757 AD cases and 6,294 elderly controls. METHODS: We genotyped eight single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the three genes DBH, IL1A and IL6. We used logistic regression models and synergy factor analysis to examine potential interactions and associations with AD. RESULTS: We found that the presence of the -1021T allele was associated with AD: odds ratio = 1.2 (95% confidence interval: 1.06-1.4, p = 0.005). This association was almost limited to men aged <75 years: odds ratio = 2.2 (1.4-3.3, 0.0004). We also found an interaction between the presence of DBH -1021T and the -889TT (rs1800587) genotype of IL1A: synergy factor = 1.9 (1.2-3.1, 0.005). All these results were consistent between Northern Europe and Northern Spain. CONCLUSIONS: Extensive previous evidence (reviewed here) indicates an important role for norepinephrine in controlling inflammation in the brain. Thus, the -1021T allele, whose activity is presumed to be low, may be associated with poor regulation of inflammation, which could contribute to the onset of AD. We suggest that such misregulation constitutes the predominant mechanism for the association we report here.\n",
      "BACKGROUND: Atrioventricular septal defects (AVSDs) present as clinical abnormalities of several different syndromes, autosomal dominant anomalies, and sporadic malformations. Therefore, there is genetic heterogeneity, but until recently little is known about the genes involved in the pathogenesis of AVSD. The CRELD1 gene, a novel cell adhesion molecule, is a candidate gene for AVSD. METHODS: This study included 133 patients with AVSD and 200 healthy controls. Peripheral blood samples were collected and genomic DNA was extracted from leukocytes. CRELD1 was amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) with specific primers. The sequences of the PCR products were compared between patients and controls. RESULTS: In one patient, a C to G transition was identified at nucleotide 857 in exon 8, resulting in an alanine to proline substitution at amino acid 286 in the first domain Calcium-binding EGF. This patient had isolated partial AVSD and the mutation was inherited from her mother. Another mutation was detected in a patient with partial AVSD and signs of Down syndrome. The heterozygous transition c.973G>A in exon 9 resulted in a substitution of lysine for glutamic acid at amino acid 325 (E325K) in the second calcium-binding EGF domain. CONCLUSIONS:Two novel CRELD1 mutations were identified in the calcium-binding EGF domain in patients with AVSD. CRELD1 is likely a susceptibility gene for AVSD and CRELD1 mutations may increase the risk of developing a heart defect rather than being a direct causal mutation.\n",
      "Congenital generalized lipodystrophy (CGL) is a rare autosomal recessive disorder characterized by an almost complete absence of adipose tissue from birth or early infancy. Mutations in the BSCL2 gene are known to result in CGL2, a more severe phenotype than CGL1, with earlier onset, greater fat loss and biochemical changes, more severe intellectual disability, and more severe cardiomyopathy. We report a 3-month-old Taiwanese boy initially presenting with a lack of subcutaneous fat, prominent musculature, generalized eruptive xanthomas, and extreme hypertriglyceridemia. Magnetic resonance imaging of the head revealed the absence of mechanical adipose tissue in the eye sockets and scalp. Hepatomegaly was observed and histological examination of a liver biopsy sample suggested severe hepatic steatosis and periportal necrosis. However, echocardiography revealed no signs of cardiomyopathy and he showed no distinct intellectual disability interfering with daily life. About a year later, an abdominal CT scan revealed enlarged kidneys. It presented a homozygous insertion of a nucleotide, 783insG (Ile262fs mutation), in exon 7 of the BSCL2 gene. We examined the genotype of CGL cases in Japan, India, China, and Taiwan and found that BSCL2 is a major causal gene for CGL in Asia.\n",
      "OBJECTIVES:EGFR mutations now guide the clinical use of EGFR-targeted therapy in lung cancer. However, standard analysis of EGFR mutations requires a minimal amount of tumor tissue, which may not be available in some situations. In this study, we combined a mass spectrometry genotyping assay (Sequenom) with mutant-enriched PCR (ME-PCR) to detect EGFR mutations in free plasma DNA from cancer patients. of the lung. METHOD: DNAs were extracted from 31 plasma samples from 31 patients and analyzed by both methods to detect EGFR Exon 19 deletion and EGFR L858R mutation. Results from plasma DNA samples were compared to EGFR mutation status obtained in tumor DNA (EGFR mutant 18/31). The relationship between EGFR mutation status in tumor and/or plasma samples and overall survival was evaluated. RESULTS: EGFR mutation status in plasma DNA was identical to that of the primary tumor in 61% of patients (19/31). By mass spectrometry genotyping, plasma samples contained mutant DNA corresponding to 5/14 EGFR Exon 19 deletions and 3/4 EGFR L858R mutations previously diagnosed in the matched tumors. Two samples were positive for plasma DNA but negative for primary tumor tissue. Results were similar for samples studied by ME-PCR. For patients treated with erlotinib, overall survival correlated with the presence of an EGFR mutation in plasma and/or tumor tissue (p = 0.002), with both patients being positive only for plasma DNA showing responses and favorable developments. CONCLUSION:Detection of EGFR mutations in plasma DNA samples by mass spectrometry genotyping and ME-PCR is feasible. A positive result for EGFR in plasma DNA has a high predictive value for tumor EGFR status and for favorable clinical outcome of EGFR-targeted therapy and could therefore be useful in guiding decisions clinical trials in patients with insufficient or unavailable tumor samples.\n",
      "The interplay between host C-C chemokine receptor type 5 (CCR5) genetic background, disease progression, and intra-host HIV-1 evolutionary dynamics remains unclear because differences in viral evolution between hosts limit the ability to draw conclusions between hosts stratified into clinically relevant populations. Similar inference problems proliferate in many measurably evolving pathogens for which intra-host sequence samples are readily available. To this end, we propose novel hierarchical phylogenetic models (HPMs) that incorporate fixed effects to test for differences in dynamics between host populations within a formal statistical framework using stochastic search variable selection and model averaging. To clarify the role of host CCR5 genetic background and disease progression on viral evolutionary patterns, we obtain gp120 envelope sequences from HIV-1 clonal variants isolated at multiple time points during 'infection among populations of HIV-1-infected individuals who harbored only CCR5 using HIV-1 variants at any time. The presence or absence of a CCR5 wt/DD32 genotype and progressive or nonprogressive course of infection stratify clinical populations in a bidirectional design. Compared to the standard approach of analyzing each patient's sequences independently, HPM provides a more efficient estimation of evolutionary parameters such as nucleotide substitution rates and d(N)/d(S) rate ratios, as shown by a significant shrinkage of the variance of the estimator. . Fixed effects also correct for non-independence of data across populations and result in an even greater reduction in individual patient estimates. Model selection suggests an association between nucleotide substitution rate and disease progression, but the role of CCR5 genotype remains elusive. Given the lack of clear d(N)/d(S) differences between patient groups, late onset of AIDS symptoms appears to be associated only with lower viral replication rates rather than differences in selection on the fixation of amino acids.\n",
      "INTRODUCTION:Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) is a complex disorder and genetically transmitted heart disease with a diverse clinical course. The objective of the present study was to examine the association of T704C polymorphism of exon 2 of the angiotensinogen (AGT) gene with HCM in a South Indian population of Andhra Pradesh. Subjects and methods. One hundred and fifty patients with HCM (90 sporadic hypertrophic cardiomyopathy [SHCM] and 60 familial hypertrophic cardiomyopathy [FHCM]) and 165 age- and sex-matched normal healthy controls, without known hypertension or left ventricular hypertrophy, were included in the study. 'study. DNA was isolated from peripheral leukocytes and the region of interest of the AGT gene carrying a methionine to threonine missense mutation at codon 235 (M235T) of exon 2 was amplified by polymerase chain reaction ( PCR). The PCR products were subjected to restriction digestion with the enzyme SfaNI. RESULTS: Significant differences were detected in the genotypic distribution (p = 0.04) as well as allele frequency (p = 0.003) between SHCM patients and controls. The polymorphism showed no association with FHCM. CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that the T allele of the AGT gene is significantly associated with SHCM in a South Indian population of Andhra Pradesh. However, we did not find a significant association between this polymorphism and FHCM.\n",
      "Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, vascular type (vEDS) (MIM #130050) is an autosomal dominant disorder caused by mutations in the type III procollagen gene (COL3A1). Most COL3A1 mutations are detected using total RNA from patient-derived fibroblasts, which requires an invasive skin biopsy. High-resolution melting curve analysis (hrMCA) has recently been developed as a method for post-PCR mutation analysis that allows simple, rapid, cost-effective, and highly sensitive mutation screening of large genes. We established an hrMCA method to screen for COL3A1 mutations using genomic DNA. PCR primer pairs for COL3A1 (52 amplicons) were designed to cover all coding regions of the 52 exons, including splice sites. We used 15 DNA samples (8 validation samples and 7 samples from clinically suspected vEDS patients) in this study. All eight known COL3A1 mutations in the validation samples were successfully detected by hrMCA. Additionally, we identified five novel COL3A1 mutations, including one deletion (c.2187delA) and one nonsense mutation (c.2992C>T) that could not be determined by the conventional total RNA method. Furthermore, we established a small amplicon genotyping (SAG) method to detect three high-frequency coding region SNPs (rs1800255:G>A, rs1801184:T>C, and rs2271683:A>G) in COL3A1 to differentiate mutations before sequencing. The use of hrMCA in combination with SAG of genomic DNA allows rapid detection of COL3A1 mutations with high efficiency and specificity. A better understanding of the genotype-phenotype correlation in COL3A1 using this method will lead to improved diagnosis and treatment.\n",
      "Drosophila ovarian germline stem cells (GSCs) are maintained by Dpp signaling and the translational repressors Pumilio (Pum) and Nanos (Nos). Upon division, Dpp signaling is turned off and Nos is downregulated in a daughter cell, causing it to transition to a differentiating cystoblast (CB). However, the downstream effectors of Pum-Nos remain unknown and how CBs lose responsiveness to Dpp is unclear. Here, we identify brain tumor (Brat) as a potent differentiation factor and target of Pum-Nos regulation. Brat is excluded from GSCs by Pum-Nos but functions with Pum in CBs to translationally repress distinct targets, including Mad and dMyc mRNAs. Regulation of both targets simultaneously reduces cellular responsiveness to Dpp signaling, forcing the cell to become refractory to the self-renewal signal. Mathematical modeling elucidates the bistability of cell fate in the Brat-mediated system, revealing how autoregulation of GSC number may result from Brat's coupling of extracellular Dpp regulation to intracellular interpretation.\n",
      "Lipoprotein glomerulopathy (LPG) is a rare disease characterized by the presence of thrombus-like deposits in markedly dilated glomerular capillaries and is often accompanied by an increase in serum apolipoprotein E (apoE) levels. Several apoE genetic mutations have been reported to be associated with LPG. In the present study, we report a LPG patient with a novel apoE mutation, apoE Osaka. The patient was a 45-year-old man hospitalized due to nephrotic syndrome. Light and electron microscopic observations of the renal biopsy clearly showed characteristic findings of LPG, including lamellar thrombi in the lumen of dilated glomerular capillaries. His apoE phenotype was apoE3/2 and he had mild dyslipidemia with a median band on polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. It is curious that the serum apoE level is within normal limits. We determined the sequence of the apoE gene using direct sequencing of polymerase chain reaction (PCR) products. Analysis of the ApoE gene showed a nucleotide substitution from G to C at codon 158 of exon 4. This mutation denoted an amino acid substitution of the arginine residue by the proline residue at position 158 of apoE. The PCR result combined with restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis also suggests that this mutation is heterozygous. It is possible that the apoE Osaka mutation causes a conformational change in the apoE protein and affects the interaction between abnormal apoE-containing lipoproteins and endothelial cells of glomerular capillaries. The precise mechanism of LPG linked to apoE Osaka, however, remains to be elucidated.\n",
      "Background: Heterozygous mutations in GUCA1A (MIM #600364) have been identified to cause autosomal dominantly inherited cone dystrophy, cone dystrophy, and macular dystrophy. However, the role of GUCA1B gene mutations in inherited retinal diseases is controversial. We therefore performed mutation analysis of the GUCA1B gene in a clinically well-characterized group of patients of European and North American geographic origin with autosomal dominantly inherited cone dystrophy and rod dystrophy. Material and methods: Twenty-four unrelated patients diagnosed with cone dystrophy or rod dystrophy according to standard diagnostic criteria and family history consistent with an autosomal dominant mode of inheritance were included in the study. Mutation analysis of all coding exons of the GUCA1B gene was performed by polymerase chain reaction amplification of genomic DNA and subsequent DNA sequencing. Results: Three different sequence variants, c.-17T>C, c.171T>C, c.465G>T were identified. The sequence variant c.465G>T encodes a conservative amino acid substitution, p.Glu155Asp, located in EF hand 4, the calcium binding site of the GCAP2 protein. All sequence variants have been previously reported in healthy subjects. Conclusion: The absence of clearly pathogenic mutations in the selected patient group suggests that the GUCA1B gene is a minor cause of retinal degenerations in Europeans or North Americans.\n",
      "INTRODUCTION: IL-17F is a novel inflammatory cytokine and plays an important role in certain autoimmune diseases. We studied the association between chronic ITP and the frequency of the single nucleotide polymorphism rs763780 (7488T/C), which causes a His-to-Arg substitution at amino acid 161. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We examined 102 patients (men/women, 40/62; median age, 42) diagnosed with chronic ITP and 188 healthy controls (men/women, 78/110; median age, 38). Genotyping was determined by the polymerase chain reaction restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) technique. RESULTS: Compared to the control group, patients with chronic ITP had a significantly lower frequency of the IL-17F 7488CC genotype (0% vs. 4.8%, P < 0.05). The number of IL-17F 7488C alleles among chronic ITP patients was also significantly lower than that in the control group (8.7% vs. 15.2% OR = 0.48, 95% CI = 0.27-0 .84, P = 0.016). Additionally, patients carrying the IL-17F 7488TT genotype presented a severe thrombocytopenic state (platelet count < 10 10(9)/L) at diagnosis compared to those carrying the IL-17F 7488TC genotype (20.9% versus 0%, P = 0.04). . CONCLUSION: These results suggest that the IL-17F 7488 T allele is significantly associated with the development of chronic ITP, suggesting a role for IL-17F in the pathogenesis of chronic ITP.\n",
      "BACKGROUND: An intragenic biallelic polymorphism (1359 G/A) of the CB1 gene resulting in substitution of G for A at nucleotide position 1359 of codon 435 (Thr), has been reported as a common polymorphism in Caucasian populations. Intervention studies with this polymorphism have not been performed. OBJECTIVE: We decided to study the role of the polymorphism (G1359A) of the CB1 receptor gene on the adipocytokine response and weight loss secondary to lifestyle modification (Mediterranean low-calorie diet and physical exercise) in obese patients. . DESIGN: A population of 94 patients suffering from obesity was analyzed. Before and after 3 months of a hypocaloric diet, an anthropometric assessment, an assessment of nutritional intake and a biochemical analysis were carried out. Statistical analysis was performed for G1359A and A1359A combined as one group and for wild-type G1359G as a second group, with one dominant model. Results: Forty-seven patients (50%) had the G1359G genotype (wild-type group) and 47 (50%) patients G1359A (41 patients, 43.6%) or A1359A (6 patients, 6.4%) (group mutant type) had the genotype. In the wild-type and mutant groups, weight, body mass index, fat mass, waist circumference and systolic blood pressure decreased. In the mutant type group, resistin (4.15 ± 1.7 ng/ml vs. 3.90 ± 2.1 ng/ml: P < 0.05), leptin (78.4 ± 69 ng/ml vs 66.2 ± 32 ng/ml: P < 0.05) and IL-6 (1.40 ± 1.9 pg/ml vs 0.81 (1.5 pg/ml: P < 0.05) decreased after dietary treatment CONCLUSION: The new discovery of this study is the association of the mutant allele (A1359) with a reduction in resistin, leptin and interleukin-6 secondary to weight loss.\n",
      "It has been shown that DNA repair is reduced in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and that the X-ray repair cross-complementation (XRCC1) polymorphism Arg399Gln (rs25487) may contribute to DNA repair. DNA. We evaluated the frequency of XRCC1 Arg399Gln substitution in SLE patients (n = 265) and controls (n = 360) in a sample from the Polish population. The odds ratio (OR) for SLE patients with Gln/Gln versus Gln/Arg or Arg/Arg genotypes was 1.553 (95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.9573-2.520; p = 0.0729 ). The OR for Gln/Gln or Gln/Arg versus Arg/Arg genotype was 1.551 (95% CI = 1.122-2.144, p = 0.0077). The OR for the 399 Gln allele in SLE patients was 1.406 (95% CI = 1.111-1.779, p = 0.0045). There was also a statistically significant p-value from test (2) for the trend observed in the XRCC1 Arg399Gln polymorphism (ptrend = 0.0048). We also found a significant contribution of the Gln/Gln or Arg/Gln versus Arg/Arg genotype to the presence of either the malar rash or the photosensitivity manifestations of SLE OR=2.241 (1.328-3.781, p=0.0023 , pcorr=0.0414). Furthermore, meta-analysis of Taiwanese, Brazilian, and Polish Han Chinese populations showed that Gln/Gln or Gln/Arg genotype and Gln allele were associated with SLE incidence. The OR for the Gln/Gln or Gln/Arg versus Arg/Arg genotype was 1.440 (95% CI=1.15-1.80, p=0.0019) and the OR for the Gln allele was 1. .27 (95% CI=1.08-1.51, p=0.0051). ). Our studies can confirm that the XRCC1 Arg399Gln polymorphism can increase the risk of SLE incidence and the occurrence of certain SLE manifestations.\n",
      "Sjögren-Larsson syndrome (SLS) is an autosomal recessive disorder characterized by ichthyosis, mental retardation, spasticity, and mutations in the ALDH3A2 gene for fatty aldehyde dehydrogenase, an enzyme that catalyzes the oxidation of fatty aldehyde in fatty acid. More than 70 mutations have been identified in SLS patients, including small deletions or insertions, missense mutations, splicing defects, and complex nucleotide changes. We now describe 2 SLS patients whose disease is caused by large contiguous genetic deletions of the ALDH3A2 locus at 17p11.2. Deletions were defined using long-range inverse PCR and microarray-based comparative genomic hybridization. A 24-year-old SLS woman was homozygous for a 352-kb deletion involving ALDH3A2 and 4 contiguous genes, including ALDH3A1, which encodes the major soluble protein of the cornea. Although free of corneal disease, she had severe symptoms of SLS with rare deterioration of oral motor function and loss of walking. The other 19-month-old patient was a compound heterozygote for a 1.44 Mb contiguous gene deletion and missense mutation (c.407C>T, P136L) in ALDH3A2. These studies suggest that large genetic deletions may account for up to 5% of SLS mutant alleles. Geneticists should consider the possibility of compound heterozygosity for large deletions in patients with SLS and other inborn errors of metabolism, which has implications for carrier testing and prenatal diagnosis.\n",
      "The major histocompatibility complex (MHC) on chromosome 6p21 is a key contributor to the genetic basis of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). Although SLE affects African Americans disproportionately compared to European Americans, there has not been a comprehensive analysis of the MHC region in relation to SLE in African Americans. We screened the MHC region for 1,536 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and C4A gene deletion in a case-control study of SLE (380 cases, 765 age-matched controls) nested within the prospective SLE study. health of black women. We also genotyped 1,509 ancestral informative markers across the genome to estimate European ancestry to control for population stratification due to population admixture. The SNP most strongly associated with SLE was rs9271366 (odds ratio, OR = 1.70, p = 5.6 · 10 (-5)) close to the HLA-DRB1 gene. Conditional haplotype analysis revealed three additional SNPs, rs204890 (OR = 1.86, p = 1.2 10(-4)), rs2071349 (OR = 1.53, p = 1.0 10(-3) ) and rs2844580 (OR = 1.43, p = 1.3 10(-3)), to be associated with SLE independently of the SNP rs9271366. On univariate analysis, the OR for C4A deletion was 1.38, p = 0.075, but after simultaneous adjustment for the other four SNPs, the odds ratio was 1.01, p = 0.98. A genotypic score combining the four newly identified SNPs showed additive risk depending on the number of high-risk alleles (OR = 1.67 per high-risk allele, p < 0.0001). Our strongest signal, SNP rs9271366, was also associated with higher risk of SLE in a previous Chinese genome-wide association study (GWAS). Additionally, two SNPs found in a GWAS of women of European ancestry were confirmed in our study, indicating that African Americans share some genetic risk factors for SLE with European and Chinese subjects. In summary, we found four independent signals in the MHC region associated with SLE risk in African American women.\n",
      "Loss or reduction in the function of tumor suppressor genes contributes to tumorigenesis. Here, by allelic DNA copy number analysis using a single nucleotide polymorphism genotyping array and mass spectrometry, we report a homozygous deletion in glioblastoma multiforme at chromosome 13q21, where the DACH1 gene. We found a decrease in cell proliferation of a series of glioma cell lines by forced expression of DACH1. We then generated U87TR-Da glioma cells, where DACH1 expression could be activated by exposure of the cells to doxycycline. Ex vivo cell proliferation and in vivo growth of s.c. tumors transplanted into mice are reduced in U87TR-Da cells with DACH1 expression (U87-DACH1-high), compared to U87TR-Da cells not expressing DACH1 (U87 -DACH1-low). U87-DACH1-low cells form spheroids with CD133 and Nestin expression in serum-free medium, but U87-DACH1-high cells do not. Compared with spheroid-forming U87-DACH1-low cells, adherent U87-DACH1-high cells exhibit lower tumorigenicity, indicating that DACH1 decreases the number of tumor-initiating cells. Gene expression analysis and chromatin immunoprecipitation assay reveal that fibroblast growth factor 2 (FGF2/bFGF) is transcriptionally repressed by DACH1, particularly in cells cultured in serum-free medium. Exogenous bFGF rescues the spheroid-forming activity and tumorigenicity of cells with high U87-DACH1 levels, suggesting that loss of DACH1 increases the number of tumor-initiating cells through transcriptional activation of bFGF. These results illustrate that DACH1 is a distinctive tumor suppressor, which not only suppresses the growth of tumor cells, but also regulates the bFGF-mediated tumor-initiating activity of glioma cells.\n",
      "The life cycle of hepatitis C virus (HCV) is closely linked to host lipoprotein metabolism. Serum lipid levels are associated with response to pegylated interferon plus ribavirin (PEG-IFN/RBV) treatment, while single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) around the human interleukin 28B (IL28B) gene locus and substitutions of amino acids in the central region of the HCV has been reported to affect the effectiveness of PEG-IFN/RBV treatment in chronic hepatitis with HCV infection of genotype 1b. The aim of this study was to elucidate the relationship between serum lipids and factors capable of predicting the effectiveness of PEG-IFN/RB treatment, with particular emphasis on apolipoprotein B-100 (apoB-100) in 148 subjects with chronic HCV G1b. infection. Our results demonstrated that the aa 70 substitution in the central region of HCV and the rs8099917 SNP located near IL28B were independent factors in determining serum levels of apoB-100 and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol ( LDL). A significant association was noted between higher levels of apoB-100 (P = 1.1·10(-3)) and LDL cholesterol (P = 0.02) and subjects with Arg70. A significant association was also observed between subjects carrying the TT rs8099917 responder genotype and higher levels of apoB-100 (P = 6.4·10(-3)) and LDL cholesterol (P = 4.2· 10(-3)). Our results suggest that apoB-100 and LDL cholesterol are markers of alteration of cellular lipoprotein pathways and/or the host endogenous interferon response to HCV in the setting of chronic HCV infection. HCV. In particular, serum apoB-100 concentration could be an informative marker to assess changes in HCV-associated intracellular lipoprotein metabolism in patients with the rs8099917 responder genotype.\n",
      "Homozygous or compound heterozygous renin (REN) mutations cause renal tubular dysgenesis, characterized by in utero death due to renal failure and pulmonary hypoplasia. The phenotype resembles fetopathy caused by taking an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor or angiotensin receptor blocker during pregnancy. Recently, heterozygous REN mutations have been shown to lead to early-onset hyperuricemia, anemia, and chronic kidney disease (CKD). To date, only 3 heterozygous REN mutations have been published. We report an analysis of REN gene mutations in 39 families with hyperuricemia and CKD who previously tested negative for UMOD (uromodulin) and HNF1B (hepatocyte nuclear factor 1b) gene mutations. We identified a relationship with a new thymidine to cytosine mutation at position 28 in the complementary DNA of the REN, corresponding to a tryptophan to arginine substitution at amino acid 10, which is found in the signal sequence (c.28T >C; p.W10R). . Based on this, we conclude that REN mutations are rare events in CKD patients. Within the family, we found affected individuals across 4 generations, carrying the novel REN mutation and characterized by anemia, hyperuricemia and significant kidney disease. The anemia was severe and out of proportion to the degree of decreased kidney function. Since all described heterozygous REN mutations are located in the signal sequence, screening for the REN gene in CKD patients with hyperuricemia and anemia may be better focused on sequencing exon 1, which encodes the signal peptide.\n",
      "OBJECTIVE:Aniridia (AN) is a rare congenital panocular disease caused by mutations in the paired-box homeotic gene 6 (PAX6). The PAX6 gene is also involved in other anterior segment malformations, including Peters anomaly. We investigated PAX6 gene mutations in a cohort of affected individuals with different clinical phenotypes, including AN, iris and choroidal coloboma, or anterior segment malformations. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Six unrelated families and 10 sporadic patients were examined clinically. After obtaining informed consent, genomic DNA was extracted from the venous blood of all participants. Mutation screening of all exons of the PAX6 gene was carried out by direct sequencing of PCR-amplified DNA fragments. Multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (MLPA) was performed to detect large deletions. RESULTS: By clinical examination, the patients and pedigrees were divided into the following three groups: AN, coloboma of the iris and choroids, and anterior segment malformations including Peters anomaly. Sequencing of the PAX6 gene, three intragenic mutations including a novel heterozygous splice site mutation c.357-3C>G (p.Ser119fsX) were identified in patients in the AN group. A novel missense mutation c.643T>C (p.S216P) was detected in the anterior segment malformation group. The p.S216P mutation located in the homeodomain region of PAX6 caused the Peters anomaly phenotype in the A6 family with different expression. Using MLPA analysis, a large deletion including the entire PAX6 gene and the DKFZ p686k1684 gene was detected in a sporadic patient in the AN group. Neither intragenic mutation nor large deletion was identified in the iris-choroidal coloboma group. CONCLUSION: Our results further confirmed that different types of mutations could cause different ocular phenotypes and that a clearly clinical classification of the phenotype could increase the detection rate of PAX6 gene mutations.\n",
      "OBJECTIVE: To identify the fibrillin-1 (FBN1) gene mutation in a Chinese family with Marfan syndrome (MFS). METHODS: Patients and family members underwent comprehensive physical, ophthalmologic, and cardiovascular examinations. Genomic DNA was extracted from venous blood leukocytes of six family individuals and 170 healthy Chinese individuals. The 65 coding exons and their flanking intronic boundaries of FBN1 were amplified in the proband by polymerase chain reaction and followed by direct sequencing. The mutation identified in the proband was screened in other family members and the 170 healthy Chinese individuals by direct sequencing. Protein conservation analysis was carried out in six species using an online tool ClustalW. Protein structure was modeled based on the Protein database and mutated in DeepView v4.0.1 to predict the functional consequences of the mutation. RESULTS: A novel heterozygous change c.3703T>C in exon 29 of FBN1 was detected in the proband, which resulted in the substitution of serine by proline at codon 1235 (p.S1235P). This mutation was also present in two family members but absent in other unaffected family members and the 170 healthy Chinese individuals. The mutant residue located in calcium-binding epidermal growth factor domain #15 is highly conserved among mammalian species and could likely induce a conformational change of the domain. CONCLUSIONS: We identified a novel mutation p.S1235P in FBN1, which is the causative mutation of MFS in this family. Our result expands the mutation spectrum of FBN1 and contributes to the study of the molecular pathogenesis of Marfan syndrome.\n",
      "BACKGROUND: The chemokine 1 receptor CXCR-1 (or IL8R-alpha) is a specific receptor for interleukin 8 (IL-8), which is chemoattractant for neutrophils and plays an important role in the inflammatory response. The rs2234671 polymorphism at position Ex2+860G>C of the CXCR1 gene causes a conservative amino acid substitution (S276T). This single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) appeared functional because it was associated with a decreased risk of lung cancer. Previous studies from our group revealed an association of haplotypes in IL8 and CXCR2 genes with chronic periodontitis, a multifactorial disease. In this study, we investigated the rs2234671 polymorphism in 395 Brazilian subjects with and without chronic periodontitis. RESULTS: A similar distribution of allelic and genotype frequencies was observed between groups (p > 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: The rs2234671 polymorphism of the CXCR1 gene was not associated with susceptibility to chronic periodontitis in the Brazilian population studied.\n",
      "We previously showed that transgenic (tg) mice expressing in B cells both BCL-2 and a TNFR-associated factor 2 (TRAF2) mutant lacking the really interesting new gene and zinc finger domains (TRAF2DN) develop small lymphocytic lymphoma and chronic lymphocytic leukemia. with a high incidence (Zapata et al. 2004. Proc. Nat. Acad. Sci. USA 101: 16600-16605). Further analysis of TRAF2 and TRAF2DN expression in purified B cells demonstrated that the expression of endogenous TRAF2 and tg TRAF2DN was negligible in Traf2DN-tg B cells compared to wild-type mice. This was the result of proteasome-dependent degradation and rendered TRAF2DN B cells into true TRAF2-deficient B cells. Similar to B cells with targeted deletion of Traf2, Traf2DN-tg mice exhibit an enlarged marginal zone B cell population and have constitutive processing of p100 NF-kappaB2. Furthermore, the expression levels of TRAF3, X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis, and Bcl-X(L) were increased, while the levels of cellular inhibitors of apoptosis 1 and 2 were significantly reduced compared to those found in wild-type B cells. Furthermore, consistent with previous results, we also show that TRAF2 was required for efficient activation of JNK and ERK in response to CD40 engagement. However, TRAF2 was found to be deleterious for BCR-mediated activation of these kinases. In contrast, TRAF2 deficiency had no effect on CD40-mediated p38 MAPK activation, but significantly reduced BCR-mediated p38 activation. Finally, we further confirm that TRAF2 was required for CD40-mediated proliferation, but its absence removed B cells from the need for B cell activating factor for survival. Overall, our results suggest that TRAF2 deficiency cooperates with BCL-2 to promote chronic lymphocytic leukemia/small lymphocytic lymphoma in mice, possibly by specifically enhancing B cell accumulation in the marginal zone, increasing the 'X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis expression and rendering B cells independent of B cell activating factor for survival.\n",
      "Some concepts regarding the modes of action of EPO/EPOR have been challenged by in vivo studies: Bcl-x levels are elevated in maturing erythroblasts, but not in their progenitors; truncated EPOR alleles lacking a major p85/PI3K recruitment site nevertheless promote polycythemia; and disruption of Erk1 unexpectedly enhances erythropoiesis. To uncover novel pathways of EPO/EPOR action, global transcriptome analyzes are currently being applied to interrogate the effects of EPO/EPOR on bone marrow-derived primary CFUe-like progenitors. A total of 160 EPO/EPOR target transcripts were significantly modulated, 2- to 21.8-fold. A unique set of EPO-regulated survival factors included Lyl1, Gas5, Pim3, Pim1, Bim, Trib3, and Serpina 3g. Cell cycle mediators modulated by EPO/EPOR included Cdc25a, Btg3, Cyclin-d2, p27-kip1, Cyclin-g2, and CyclinB1-IP-1. EPO regulation of signal transduction factors was also complex and interesting. For example, not only Socs3 plus Socs2 but also Spred2, Spred1, and Eaf1 were induced by EPO as negative feedback components. Socs2, along with five additional targets, were further found to contain novel response genes EPOR/Jak2/Stat5 (which are important for erythropoiesis during anemia). Among the receptors, an atypical TNF receptor, Tnfr-sf13c, was modulated more than 5-fold by EPO. Functionally, Tnfr-sf13c ligation was found to both promote proerythroblast survival and significantly enhance erythroblast formation. EPOR therefore engages a sophisticated set of transcriptome response circuits, with Tnfr-sf13c deployed as a novel positive regulator of proerythroblast formation.\n",
      "Scleroderma renal crisis (SRC) is a rare complication of systemic sclerosis (SSc), but can be severe enough to require temporary or permanent renal replacement therapy. Moderate to high dose corticosteroid use is recognized as a major risk factor for CRS. Additionally, cases of thrombotic microangiopathy precipitated by cyclosporine have been reported in patients with SSc. In this article, we report a patient with CRS induced by tacrolimus and corticosteroids. The aim of this work is to draw attention to the risk of tacrolimus use in patients with SSc.\n",
      "BACKGROUND: To evaluate the association of variation in genes involved in the immune response, including IL10, production and detoxification of reactive oxygen species, and repair of oxidative DNA damage with the risk of recurrence after surgery for localized prostate cancer. METHODS: We conducted a nested case-control study of men who underwent radical prostatectomy between 1993 and 2001. A total of 484 recurrence cases and 484 controls were matched by age, race, pathological stage and grade. Germline DNA was extracted from unaffected paraffin-embedded lymph nodes. We genotyped candidate single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in IL10, CRP, GPX1, GSR, GSTP1, hOGG1, IL1B, IL1RN, IL6, IL8, MPO, NOS2, NOS3, SOD1, SOD2, SOD3, TLR4, and TNF and marked the SNPs . in IL10, CRP, GSR, IL1RN, IL6, NOS2 and NOS3. We used conditional logistic regression to estimate OR and 95% confidence intervals (CI). RESULTS:The minor allele (A) of IL10 rs1800872, known to produce less interleukin-10 (IL-10), was associated with a higher risk of recurrence (OR = 1.76, 95% CI : 1.00-3.10), and the minor allele (A) allele (G) in rs1800896, known to produce more of IL-10, was associated with a lower risk of recurrence (OR = 0.66, 95% CI: 0.48-0.91). We also observed associations of candidate SNPs in CRP, GSTP1, and IL1B. One common IL10 haplotype and 2 common NOS2 haplotypes were associated with recurrence. CONCLUSION:Variation of IL10, CRP, GSTP1, IL1B, and NOS2 was associated with prostate cancer recurrence, independent of pathological prognostic factors. IMPACT: This study confirms that genetic variation in immune response and oxidation influences the risk of prostate cancer recurrence and suggests that genetic variation in these pathways may inform prognosis.\n",
      "The developing brain is highly susceptible to hypoxic-ischemic (HI) injury leading to severe neurological impairment in surviving infants and children. Previously, we reported the induction of neuronal pentraxin 1 (NP1), a novel neuronal protein of the long pentraxin family, following HI neuronal injury. Here, we investigated how this specific signal propagates to cause HI neuronal death. We used hippocampal cultures from wild-type (WT) and NP1 knockout (NP1-KO) mice, modeled in vitro after exposure to oxygen and glucose deprivation (OGD) and a neonatal mouse model. in vivo (P9-10) of HI brain injury. Our results show induction of NP1 in primary hippocampal neurons after exposure to other organisms (4–8 h) and in ipsilateral hippocampal CA1 and CA3 regions 24–48 h after HI compared to contralateral side. We also found increased PTEN activity concomitant with dephosphorylation of Akt (Ser473) and GSK-3b (Ser9) in a time-dependent (4–8 h) manner in other departments. The other drugs also caused a time-dependent decrease in the phosphorylation of Bad (Ser136) and Bax protein levels. Immunofluorescence staining and subcellular fractionation analyzes revealed increased mitochondrial translocation of Bad and Bax proteins from the cytoplasm after further examination (4 h) and concurrent increased release of Cyt C from mitochondria, followed by activation of caspase-3. NP1 protein was immunoprecipitated with Bad and Bax proteins; OGD caused increased interactions of NP1 with Bad and Bax, thereby facilitating their mitochondrial translocation and dissipation of mitochondrial membrane potential (D(m)). This induction of NP1 preceded increased mitochondrial release of cytochrome C (Cyt C) into the cytosol, activation of caspase-3, and time-dependent cell death of OGDs in primary WT hippocampal neurons. In contrast, in NP1-KO neurons, there was no translocation of Bad and Bax from cytosol to mitochondria, nor any evidence of loss of D(m), increased release of Cyt C and l 'activation of caspase-3 after other departments; which resulted in a significant reduction in neuronal death. Our results indicate a regulatory role for NP1 in Bad/Bax-dependent mitochondrial release of Cyt C and activation of caspase-3. Together, our results demonstrate a novel mechanism by which NP1 regulates mitochondria-induced hippocampal cell death; suggesting NP1 as a potential therapeutic target against HI brain injury in neonates.\n",
      "Delta-like 4 (Dll4) is a ligand of the Notch family of pathways that has been extensively studied in the context of tumor angiogenesis, with its blockade resulting in nonproductive angiogenesis and tumor growth arrest. As Dll4 inhibitors enter the clinic, it becomes necessary to understand their side effects, namely the systemic consequences of blocking Dll4:Notch in tissues other than tumors. The present study focused on the effects of systemic targeting of anti-Dll4 in the bone marrow (BM) microenvironment. Here we show that blocking Dll4 with monoclonal antibodies disrupts the BM vascular niche of sublethally irradiated mice, leading to increased CD31(+), VE-Cadherin(+) and c-kit() vessel density. +), as well as an increase in megakaryocytes, while the density of CD105(+), VEGFR3(+), SMA(+) and lectin(+) vessels remained unchanged. We also studied angiocrine gene expression upon Dll4 treatment in vivo and demonstrate that IGFbp2, IGFbp3, Angpt2, Dll4, DHH, and VEGF-A are upregulated, while FGF1 and CSF2 are reduced. In vitro treatment of endothelial cells with anti-Dll4 reduced Akt phosphorylation while maintaining similar levels of Erk 1/2 phosphorylation. In addition to its effects on the vascular niche of the BM, anti-Dll4 treatment disrupted hematopoiesis, as evidenced by increased content of myeloid BM (CD11b(+)), decreased content of lymphoid B BM ( B220(+)) and T (CD3(+)) treated mice. , with a corresponding increase in the number of circulating myeloid cells. Furthermore, anti-Dll4 treatment also increased the number of CFU-M and -G colonies in methylcellulose assays, independent of Notch1. Finally, anti-Dll4 treatment of donor BM improved hematopoietic recovery of lethally irradiated transplant recipients. Together, our data reveal that the hematopoietic (BM) effects of systemic anti-Dll4 treatment result from qualitative vascular changes as well as direct modulation of hematopoietic cells, which may be favorable in the transplantation setting.\n",
      "OBJECTIVE:Oxidative stress and endoplasmic reticulum stress (ER stress) are causal events in diabetic embryopathy. We tested whether oxidative stress causes ER stress. STUDY DESIGN: Wild-type (WT) and superoxide dismutase 1 (SOD1) overexpressing embryos at day 8.75 from a non-diabetic WT control with a SOD1 transgenic male and a diabetic WT female with a SOD1 transgenic male were analyzed for ER stress markers: C/EBP homologous protein. (CHOP), calnexin, eukaryotic initiation factor 2a (eIF2a), protein kinase ER ribonucleic acid (RNA)-like kinase (PERK), immunoglobulin binding protein, protein disulfide isomerase family A member 3, protein kinases -1a requiring inositol (IRE1a) and X-box binding protein (XBP1) messenger RNA (mRNA) splicing. RESULTS: Maternal diabetes significantly increased the levels of CHOP, calnexin, phosphorylated (p)-eIF2a, p-PERK, and p-IRE1a; triggered XBP1 mRNA splicing; and enhanced ER chaperone gene expression in WT embryos. Overexpression of SOD1 blocked these diabetes-induced ER stress markers. CONCLUSION: Attenuation of oxidative stress via SOD1 overexpression blocks maternal diabetes-induced ER stress in vivo.\n",
      "Bortezomib (bort)-dexamethasone (dex) is an effective treatment for relapsed/refractory (R/R) multiple myeloma (MM). This retrospective study examined the combination of bort (1.3 mg/m(2) on days 1, 4, 8 and 11 every 3 weeks) and dex (20 mg on the day and day after abortion) as salvage treatment in 85 patients. patients with R/R MM after autologous stem cell transplantation or conventional chemotherapy. The median number of prior lines of therapy was 2. Eighty-seven percent of patients had received immunomodulatory medications included in a line of therapy before bort-dex. The median number of bort-dex cycles was 6, up to a maximum of 12 cycles. By intention to treat, 55% of patients achieved at least a partial response, including 19% CR and 35% achieved at least a very good partial response. The median durations of response, time to next treatment, and treatment-free interval were 8, 11.2, and 5.1 months, respectively. The most important adverse event was peripheral neuropathy, which occurred in 78% of patients (grade II, 38%; grade III, 21%) and led to treatment discontinuation in 6%. With a median follow-up of 22 months, the median time to progression, progression-free survival (PFS), and overall survival (OS) were 8.9, 8.7, and 22 months, respectively. Prolonged PFS and OS were observed in patients achieving CR and receiving bort-dex as a single line of prior therapy. Bort-dex has been shown to be an effective salvage treatment for patients with MM, especially for those in first relapse.\n",
      "Ifosfamide (IFO) is an alkylating nitrogen mustard administered as an antineoplasmic agent. It is characterized by its intense urotoxic action, leading to hemorrhagic cystitis. This side effect of IFO raises the need for co-administration with sodium 2-sulfanylethanesulfonate (Mesna) in an attempt to avoid or minimize this effect. IFO and Mesna were administered separately to rabbit lymphocytes in vivo, which were then expanded in vitro. Cytogenetic markers for sister chromatid exchanges (SCE), proliferation rate index (PRI), and mitotic index were recorded. The action of Mesna, in conjunction with IFO, reduces the frequency of SCE, compared to SCE recordings obtained when IFO is administered alone. Furthermore, when high concentrations of Mesna were administered alone, significant reductions in PRI were observed, compared to IFO acting at the same concentration on lymphocytes. Mesna significantly reduces the genotoxicity of IFO, while when administered at high concentrations it acts inhibitory on the cytostatic action of the drug.\n",
      "Chronic pulsatile levodopa treatment for Parkinson's disease (PD) results in the development of motor fluctuations and dyskinesias. We investigated the prevalence and predictors of levodopa-induced dyskinesia in multi-ethnic Malaysian patients with PD. METHODS: This is a cross-sectional study involving 95 PD patients on uninterrupted levodopa treatment for at least 6 months. The instrument used was the UPDRS questionnaires. Predictors of dyskinesia were determined using multivariate logistic regression analysis. RESULTS: The mean age was 65.6 + 8.5 years. The average age of onset was 58.5 + 9.8 years. Median disease duration was 6 (7) years. Dyskinesia was present in 44% (n = 42) with a median levodopa treatment of 3 years. There were 64.3% Chinese, 31% Malays and 3.7% Indians and other ethnic groups. Eighty-one percent of patients with dyskinesia showed clinical fluctuations. Patients with dyskinesia had a lower age of onset ( p < 0.001), a longer duration of levodopa treatment ( p < 0.001), a longer duration of illness ( p < 0.001), a total daily dose of higher levodopa ( p < 0.001) and higher total UPDRS scores ( p = 0.005) than patients without dyskinesia. The three significant predictors of dyskinesia were duration of levodopa treatment, age of onset, and total daily levodopa dose. CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of levodopa-induced dyskinesia in our patients was 44%. The most significant predictors were duration of levodopa treatment, total daily levodopa dose, and age of treatment onset.\n",
      "Mutations in nuclear genes associated with defective complex III (cIII) of the mitochondrial respiratory chain are rare, having been found in only two cIII assembly factors and, as private changes in single families, in three subunits structural cIII. Recently, human LYRM7/MZM1L, the ortholog of yeast MZM1, was identified as a novel cIII assembly factor. In a baby patient with severe, early-onset encephalopathy, lactic acidosis, and isolated profound cIII deficiency in skeletal muscle, we identified a homozygous disease-segregating mutation (c.73G>A) in LYRM7/MZM1L, predicting a dramatic change from a high rate of disease segregation. conserved amino acid residue (p.Asp25Asn). In an mzm1D yeast strain, expression of a mutant mzm1(D25N) allele caused a temperature-sensitive respiratory growth defect, decreased oxygen consumption, impaired Rieske Fe protein maturation/stabilization -S and a reduction in the activity and quantity of complex III. LYRM7/MZM1L is a new pathological gene, causing severe, cIII-defective, early-onset mitochondrial encephalopathy.\n",
      "Genome-wide epigenetic reprogramming is necessary for successful preimplantation development. Inappropriate or deficient chromatin regulation can lead to defective lineage specification and loss of genomic imprinting, thereby compromising normal development. Here we report that two members of the RNA polymerase II-associated factor (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) homologous complex (PAF1 complex) components, Ctr9 and Rtf1, are required during mammalian preimplantation development. We demonstrate that Ctr9-deficient embryos fail to correctly specify lineages at the blastocyst stage. The expression of some lineage-specific factors is markedly reduced in Ctr9 knockdown embryos, including Eomes, Elf5, and Sox2, while others are inappropriately expressed (Oct4, Nanog, Gata6, Fgf4, and Sox17). We also show that several imprinted genes (Mest, Peg3, Snrpn and Meg3) are aberrantly expressed although allele-specific DNA methylation is not altered. We document a loss of histone H3 lysine 36 (H3K36me3) trimethylation in Ctr9-deficient embryos and confirm that inactivation of Setd2 or Rtf1 results in similar phenotypes. These results show that the PAF1 complex is required for mammalian development, likely through regulation of H3K36me3, and indicate a functional conservation of the PAF1 complex from yeast to mammals in vivo.\n",
      "Basic and clinical research has demonstrated that sporadic Alzheimer's disease (sAD) dementia is associated with dysfunction of the insulin receptor (IR) system, followed by decreased glucose transport via the insulin transporter. GLUT4 glucose and decreased glucose metabolism in brain cells. An alternative source of energy is d-galactose (the C-4 epimer of d-glucose) which is transported into the brain by the insulin-independent transporter GLUT3 where it could be metabolized to glucose via the Leloir pathway. Exclusively parenteral daily injections of galactose induce memory deterioration in rodents and are used to generate an animal aging model, but the effects of oral galactose treatment on cognitive functions have never been tested. We investigated the effects of continuous daily oral galactose treatment (200 mg/kg/day) on cognitive deficits in the streptozotocin-induced rat model (STZ-icv) of TAs, tested by Morris Water Maze and the passive avoidance test, respectively. One month of oral galactose treatment initiated immediately after STZ-icv administration successfully prevented the development of STZ-icv-induced cognitive deficits. The beneficial effect of oral galactose was independent of rat age and galactose dose ranging from 100 to 300 mg/kg/day. Additionally, oral administration of galactose resulted in the appearance of galactose in the blood. The increase in galactose concentration in cerebrospinal fluid was several times lower after oral administration than after parenteral administration of the same dose of galactose. Oral exposure to galactose may have beneficial effects on learning and memory ability and may be worth investigating to improve cognitive deficits associated with glucose hypometabolism in AD.\n",
      "Takotsubo syndrome (TS), also known as broken heart syndrome, is characterized by apical ballooning of the left ventricle with elevated cardiac biomarkers and electrocardiographic changes suggestive of acute coronary syndrome (i.e. (i.e. ST segment elevation, T wave inversions and pathological Q waves). . We report the case of a 54-year-old woman with a medical history of mitral valve prolapse and migraines, who was admitted to the hospital for substernal chest pain and whose electrocardiogram demonstrated elevation of the 1/2 mm ST segment in leads II, III, aVF, V5 and V6 and troponin I positive. Emergent coronary angiography revealed normal coronary arteries with moderately reduced left ventricular ejection fraction with wall motion abnormalities consistent with TS. The detailed history obtained retrospectively revealed that the patient took zolmitriptan sparingly only when experiencing migraines. But before this event, she was taking zolmitriptan 2-3 times a day for several days due to a persistent migraine. She further stated that she was very active, riding horses and show jumping with no limitations in her physical activity. There was no evidence of recent stress or migraine. An extensive literature search revealed several cases of coronary artery vasospasm secondary to zolmitriptan, but none of these cases were associated with TS.\n",
      "Cholecystokinin-octapeptide (CCK-8), which is a typical brain and gut peptide, exerts a wide range of biological activities on the central nervous system. We previously reported that CCK-8 significantly attenuated morphine-induced amnesia and reversed the decrease in spine density in the CA1 region of the hippocampus in morphine-treated animals. Here, we investigated the effects of CCK-8 on long-term potentiation (LTP) in the lateral perforant path (LPP)-rat dentate gyrus (DG) granule cell synapse in saline-treated rats. acute or morphine. Population spikes (PS), caused by stimulation of the LPP, were recorded in the DG region. Acute treatment with morphine (30 mg/kg, s.c.) significantly attenuated hippocampal LTP, and CCK-8 (1 ug, icv) restored PS amplitude attenuated by injection of morphine. Moreover, microinjection of CCK-8 (0.1 and 1 ug, icv) also significantly increased hippocampal LTP in saline-treated rats (1 ml/kg, s.c.). Pretreatment of the CCK2 receptor antagonist L-365,260 (10 ug, icv) reversed the effects of CCK-8, but not the CCK1 receptor antagonist L-364,718 (10 ug, icv). The present results demonstrate that CCK-8 attenuates the effect of morphine on hippocampal LTP via CCK2 receptors and suggest an ameliorative function of CCK-8 on morphine-induced memory impairment.\n",
      "Cultivated Cordyceps sinensis (CMCS) mycelium has been widely used for various diseases, including liver injury. The present study aims to investigate the protective effects of CMCS on liver sinusoidal endothelial cells (LSEC) in acute liver injury and the associated mechanisms of action. Mice were injected intraperitoneally with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and D-galactosamine (D-GalN). 39 male BABL/c mice were randomly divided into four groups: normal control, model control, CMCS treatment and 1,10-phenanthroline treatment groups. Serum liver function parameters, including alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST), were analyzed with the commercial kit. Inflammation and scaffold structure in the liver were stained with hematoxylin, eosin, and silver, respectively. LSECs and subendothelial basement membrane were observed using scanning and transmission electron microscopy. The protein expressions of intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) and vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1) in the liver were analyzed by Western blotting. Expression of von Willebrand factor (vWF) was studied by immunofluorescence staining. Lipid peroxidation indicators, including antisuperoxideanion (ASAFR), hydroxyl free radical (.OH), superoxide dismutase (SOD), malondialdehyde, and glutathione S-transferase (GST), were determined using kits and matrix metalloproteinase-2 and 9 (MMP-2/9) activities in the liver were analyzed respectively by zymography at the gelatin and in situ fluorescent zymography. The model mice had much higher serum levels of ALT and AST than normal mice. Compared to that of normal control, more severe hepatic inflammation and hepatocyte apoptosis, more severe hepatic lipid peroxidation demonstrated by increased ASAFR, .OH and MDA, but decreased SOD and GST, an increase in MMP-2/9 and VCAM-1, ICAM activities. The -1 and vWF expressions, which revealed obvious LSEC injury and scaffold structure disruption, were presented in the model control. Compared with the model group, CMCS and 1,10-phenanthroline significantly improved serum ALT/AST, attenuated hepatic inflammation and improved liver peroxidative injury, decreased MMP-2/9 activities in liver tissues , improved the integration of the scaffold structure and decreased the proteins. expression of VCAM-1 and ICAM-1. CMCS could protect LSECs against injury and maintain microvasculature integration in LPS/D-GalN-induced mouse injured liver. Its mechanism of action was associated with downregulation of MMP-2/9 activities and inhibition of peroxidation in the injured liver.\n",
      "Reactive oxygen species (ROS) are involved in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis and coronary heart disease (CAD). NADPH oxidases are the main source of ROS in the vascular system. p22phox is an essential component of vascular NADPH oxidases and is encoded by the CYBA (cytochrome b245 alpha) gene. The -930A>G CYBA polymorphism (rs9932581:A>G) modulates CYBA promoter activity and influences CYBA transcriptional activity. The aim of the present study was to analyze a possible association between the -930A>G polymorphism and coronary artery disease and to search for traditional gene-risk factor interactions. 480 subjects were studied: 240 patients with premature coronary artery disease, 240 blood donors of the same age and sex. The -930A>G polymorphism was genotyped using the TaqMan pre-designed SNP genotyping assay (Applied Biosystems). Carrier status of the -930G allele was a risk factor for CHD (OR 2.03, 95% CI 1.21-3.44, P = 0.007). A synergistic effect of the -930G allele with overweight/obesity (BMI -25) and smoking was noted. The estimated risk of CHD for the -25 BMI and -930G allele interaction was approximately 160% higher than predicted assuming additivity of effects, and approximately 40% higher for the smoking interaction. and the -930G allele. Overweight/obesity was a risk factor for CHD only in carriers of the -930G allele (P<10(-10)) but not in AA homozygotes (P=1.00). In conclusion, the -930A>G CYBA polymorphism is associated with CAD in the Polish population. Carriers of the -930G allele are particularly exposed to the consequences of obesity and exposure to tobacco smoke.\n",
      "Dexamethasone (Dex)-induced hypertension is associated with increased oxidative stress. Lactoferrin (LF) is an iron-binding glycoprotein with antihypertensive properties. In this study, we investigated the effect of chronic LF administration on oxidative stress and hypertension during Dex administration. Male Wistar rats were treated with Dex (30 µg/kg/day subcutaneously) or saline for 14 days. Oral bovine FL (30, 100, 300 mg/kg) was administered from day 8 to day 14 in a reversal study. In a prevention study, rats received 4 days of LF treatment followed by Dex and continued during the testing period. Systolic blood pressure (SBP) was measured using the tail cuff method. Thymus weight was used as a marker of glucocorticoid activity. Plasma hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) concentration and ferric reducing antioxidant power (FRAP) value were determined. Dexamethasone significantly increased SBP and plasma H2O2 level and decreased thymus and body weight. LF reduced (P < 0.01) and dose-dependently (P < 0.001) prevented Dex-induced hypertension. LF prevented body weight loss and significantly reduced the increase in plasma H2O2 level and the increase in FRAP values. Chronic administration of LF markedly reduced blood pressure and ROS production and improved antioxidant capacity in Dex-induced hypertension, suggesting the role of inhibition of oxidative stress as another mechanism of antihypertensive action of the LF.\n",
      "Due to the lack of contemporary data regarding seizures after cardiac surgery, we undertook a retrospective analysis of prospectively collected data from 11,529 patients in whom cardiopulmonary bypass was used between January 2004 and December 2010. convulsive seizure was defined as a transient episode of disturbances. brain function characterized by abnormal involuntary motor movements. Multivariate regression analysis was performed to identify independent predictors of postoperative seizures. A total of 100 (0.9%) patients developed postoperative seizures. Generalized and focal seizures were identified in 68 and 32 patients, respectively. Median (IQR [range]) time after surgery when seizure occurred was 7 (6-12 [1-216]) hr and 8 (6-11 [4-18]) hr, respectively. Epileptiform signs on electroencephalography were observed in 19 patients. Independent predictors of postoperative seizures included age, female gender, repeat cardiac surgery, ascending aortic calcification, congestive heart failure, deep hypothermic circulatory arrest, duration of aortic cross-clamping and tranexamic acid. When tested in multivariate regression analysis, tranexamic acid was a strong independent predictor of seizures (OR 14.3, 95% CI 5.5-36.7; p < 0.001). Patients with seizures had 2.5 times higher in-hospital mortality rates and twice as long hospital stay as patients without seizures. The mean (IQR [range]) length of intensive care unit stay was 115 (49-228 [32-481]) h in patients with seizures compared with 26 (22-69 [14-1080]) h in patients without seizures. seizures (p < 0.001). Seizures are a serious postoperative complication after cardiac surgery. Tranexamic acid being the only modifiable factor, its administration, particularly at doses greater than 80 mg.kg(-1), must be weighed against the risk of postoperative convulsions.\n",
      "PURPOSE: Reactive oxygen species (ROS) generated by NADPH oxidase are involved in angiogenesis. The NADPH oxidase isoforms NOX1, NOX2 and NOX4 are reported to be expressed in endothelial cells (ECs). Among these, NOX1 and NOX2 are thought to contribute to intravitreal neovascularization (IVNV) in models of oxygen-induced retinopathy (OIR). In this study, we tested the hypothesis that the NOX4 isoform in ECs contributes to vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-induced angiogenesis and IVNV. METHODS: NADPH oxidase mRNA isoforms were measured in several types of cultured vascular ECs: human retinal microvascular ECs (hRMVECs), choroidal ECs (CECs), and human umbilical vascular ECs (HUVECs) at l using real-time PCR. Neonates and maternal rats were placed in an OIR model that varied the oxygen concentration between 50% and 10% every 24 h for 14 days and then were placed in room air (RA) for 4 additional days (OIR rat model). Expression of NOX4 in retinal lysates of RA-reared pups at postnatal days 0 (P0), P14, and P18 was determined by Western blotting. STAT3 activation was determined as the ratio of phosphorylated STAT3 to total STAT3 with Western blot analysis of retinal lysates from rat pups raised in RA or the rat OIR model at P18. Semi-quantitative assessment of the density of NOX4 co-labeling with lectin-stained retinal ECs was determined by immunostaining of retinal cryosections from P18 pups in OIR or PR. In hRMVECs transfected with NOX4 siRNA and treated with VEGF or control, 1) ROS generation was measured using 5-(and-6)-chloromethyl-2',7'-dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate , acetyl ester fluorescence assay and 2) phosphorylated VEGF receptor. 2 and STAT3, as well as total VEGFR2 and STAT3 were measured in Western blot analyses. VEGF-stimulated hRMVEC proliferation was measured after transfection with NOX4 siRNA or STAT3 siRNA, or respective controls. RESULTS: NOX4 was the most prevalent isoform of NADPH oxidase in vascular ECs. NOX4 expression in retinal lysates was significantly decreased during the development of RA. Compared to RA, retinal NOX4 expression increased at P18. At p18 OIR, semi-quantitative assessment of lectin density and NOX4 colabeling in retinal vascular ECs was higher in retinal cryosections and activated STAT3 was higher in retinal lysates than in RA-reared pups. In cultured hRMVECs, knockdown of NOX4 by siRNA transfection inhibited VEGF-induced ROS generation. VEGF induced physical interaction of phosphorylated VEGFR2 and NOX4. NOX4 knockdown: 1) reduced but did not abolish VEGFR2 activation and 2) suppressed STAT3 activation in response to VEGF. Knockdown of NOX4 or STAT3 inhibited VEGF-induced EC proliferation. CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggest that in a representative model of human retinopathy of prematurity, NOX4 increased at the time IVNV developed. VEGF-activated NOX4 led to an interaction between VEGF-activated VEGFR2 and NOX4 that mediated EC proliferation via STAT3 activation. Overall, our results suggest that NOX4 might regulate VEGFR2-mediated IVNV via STAT3 activation.\n",
      "The cloaca is temporally formed and ultimately divided by the urorectal septum (URS) during the development of the urogenital and anorectal organs. Although congenital malformations, such as anorectal malformations (ARM), are frequently observed during this process, the underlying pathogenic mechanisms remain unclear. b-Catenin is an essential component of canonical Wnt signaling and is essential for the regulation of cell differentiation and morphogenesis during embryogenesis. β-Catenin expression is observed in endodermal epithelia, including URS epithelia. We conditionally modulated the b-catenin gene in endodermal epithelia using the tamoxifen-inducible Cre driver line (Shh(CreERT2)). Loss- and gain-of-function (LOF and GOF) mutants of b-catenin exhibited abnormal clefts in the perineal region and hypoplastic elongation of the URS. The mutants also exhibited reduced cell proliferation in the URS mesenchyme. Furthermore, GOF b-catenin mutants exhibited reduced apoptosis and then increased apoptosis in the URS epithelium. This instability likely resulted in reduced expression levels of differentiation markers, such as keratin 1 and filaggrin, in perineal epithelia. The expression of bone morphogenetic protein (Bmp) genes, such as Bmp4 and Bmp7, was also ectopically induced in URS epithelia in GOF β-catenin mutants. Expression of the Msx2 gene and phosphorylated Smad1/5/8, possible readouts of Bmp signaling, was also increased in the mutants. Additionally, we introduced an additional mutation for a Bmp receptor gene: BmprIA. The Hush (CreERT2/+); b-catenin (flox (ex3)/+); BmprIA(flox/-) mutants showed partial restoration of URS elongation compared to b-catenin GOF mutants. These results indicate that some ARM phenotypes in GOF b-catenin mutants were caused by abnormal Bmp signaling. The current analysis revealed the close relationship between endodermal b-catenin signaling and ARM phenotypes. These results are considered to shed light on the pathogenic mechanisms of human ARM.\n",
      "Regimens containing high-dose bortezomib and dexamethasone are considered generally tolerable with few serious bacterial infections in patients with B-cell malignancies. However, information is limited regarding the safety of the regimen in patients aged. We report the case of a 76-year-old man with Waldenstrom's macroglobulinemia who suffered from necrotizing fasciitis without neutropenia after combined treatment with bortezomib, high-dose dexamethasone, and rituximab. Despite immediate intravenous antimicrobial treatment, he succumbed 23 hours after onset. Physicians should recognize the possibility of fatal bacterial infections related to high-dose bortezomib and dexamethasone in elderly patients, and we believe this case merits further investigation.\n",
      "Opioid-induced hyperalgesia (OIH) is characterized by nociceptive sensitization caused by cessation of chronic opioid use. OIH may limit the clinical use of opioid analgesics and complicate withdrawal from opioid dependence. In this study, we investigated the effects of ginsenosides Re, Rg1, and Rb1, the bioactive components of ginseng, on OIH. OIH was obtained in mice after subcutaneous administration of morphine for 7 consecutive days, three times per day. During withdrawal (days 8 and 9), these mice received intragastric administration of Re, Rg1, or Rb1 twice daily. On the test day (day 10), mice were subjected to the thermal sensitivity test and the acetic acid-induced writhing test. Re (300 mg/kg) inhibited OIH in both the thermal sensitivity test and the acetic acid-induced writhing test. However, the ginsenosides Rg1 and Rb1 failed to prevent OIH in both assays. Furthermore, Rg1 showed a tendency to aggravate OIH in the acetic acid-induced torsion test. Our data suggest that ginsenoside Re, but not Rg1 or Rb1, may contribute to the reversal of OIH.\n",
      "Field potential duration (FPD) in human-induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes (hiPS-CM), which can express the QT interval in an electrocardiogram, would be a useful tool to predict the K(+) channel ) and Ca(2+). ) channel blocker effects on the QT interval. However, there are no reports showing that this technique can be used to predict the potential for multichannel blockade of QT interval prolongation. The aim of this study is to show that the FPD of the MEA (Multielectrode array) of hiPS-CM can detect the prolongation of the QT interval induced by multichannel blockers. hiPS-CMs were seeded on MEA and FPD was measured for 2 min every 10 min for 30 min after drug exposure for vehicle and concentration of each drug. IKr and IKs blockers prolong the corrected FPD (FPDc) in a concentration-dependent manner, while Ca(2+) channel blockers shorten the FPDc in a concentration-dependent manner. Furthermore, the multichannel blockers Amiodarone, Paroxetine, Terfenadine, and Citalopram prolonged FPDc in a concentration-dependent manner. Finally, the IKr blockers terfenadine and citalopram, which are reported to cause torsades de pointes (TdP) in clinical practice, produced early afterdepolarization (EAD). hiPS-CMs using MEA and FPDc can predict the effects of drug candidates on the QT interval. This study also shows that this test can help detect EAD for drugs with TdP potential.\n",
      "Unraveling the mechanisms of hematopoiesis regulated by several cytokines remains a challenge in hematology. IL-3 is an allergic cytokine with multilineage potential, while CSF-1 is produced at steady state with restricted lineage coverage. Here, we discovered the instructive role of CSF-1 in IL-3-mediated hematopoiesis. CSF-1 significantly promoted IL-3-induced CD11c+ cell expansion and attenuated the generation of basophils and mast cells from C57BL/6 bone marrow. Further studies indicated that the CSF-1/CSF-1R axis significantly contributed to IL-3-induced CD11c+ cell generation by enhancing c-Fos-associated monopoiesis. CD11c+ cells induced by IL-3 or IL-3/CSF-1 were competent in cell maturation and endocytosis. IL-3 and IL-3/CSF-1 cells did not have the classic appearance of dendritic cells and resembled macrophages in terms of morphology. Both populations produced a high level of IL-10, in addition to IL-1, IL-6 and TNFa, in response to LPS, and were relatively weak T cell stimulators. Collectively, these results reveal the role of CSF-1 in mediating the hematopoietic IL-3 pathway via monopoiesis, which regulates the expansion of CD11c+ macrophages.\n",
      "Aconitine is a high-content major bioactive diterpenoid alkaloid derived from aconitum plants. Emerging evidence indicates that voltage-gated Na(+) channels play a central role in aconitine cardiotoxicity. However, no reports are available on the role of Ca(2+) in aconitine poisoning. In this study, we explored the importance of pathological Ca(2+) signaling in aconitine poisoning in vitro and in vivo. We found that Ca(2+) overload led to increased beat rates in adult rat ventricular myocytes and caused arrhythmia in conscious, freely moving rats. To study the effects of aconitine on myocardial damage, we performed a cytotoxicity test on rat neonatal ventricular myocytes (NRVM), as well as measured the level of lactate dehydrogenase in the NRVM culture medium and the activities of Serum cardiac enzymes in rats. The results showed that aconitine caused myocardial damage and reduced NRVM viability in a dose-dependent manner. To confirm the pro-apoptotic effects, we performed flow cytometry detection, cardiac histology, transmission electron microscopy, and terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP-biotin end-labeling assay. The results showed that aconitine stimulated apoptosis in a time-dependent manner. Analysis of Ca(2+) handling protein expression demonstrated that aconitine promoted Ca(2+) overload through regulation of Ca(2+) handling protein expression . Expression analysis of apoptosis-related proteins revealed that the expression of pro-apoptotic proteins was upregulated and the expression of anti-apoptotic protein BCL-2 was downregulated. Furthermore, increased phosphorylation of MAPK family members, particularly of the P-P38/P38 ratio, was observed in cardiac tissues. Therefore, our results suggest that aconitine significantly aggravates Ca(2+) overload, causes arrhythmia, and ultimately promotes apoptotic development via phosphorylation of mitogen-activated protein kinase P38.\n",
      "Acute metformin treatment has a protective effect in myocardial infarction by suppressing inflammatory responses due to activation of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK). In the present study, the effect of chronic metformin pretreatment on cardiac dysfunction and Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) activities after myocardial infarction and their relationship with AMPK were evaluated. Male Wistar rats were randomly assigned to one of 5 groups (n = 6): normal control and isoproterenol-injected groups after chronic pretreatment with 0, 25, 50, or 100 mg/kg of metformin twice daily for 14 days. Isoproterenol (100 mg/kg) was injected subcutaneously on days 13 and 14 to induce acute myocardial infarction. Isoproterenol alone decreased left ventricular systolic pressure and myocardial contractility indexed as LVdp/dtmax and LVdp/dtmin. Left ventricular dysfunction was significantly lower in the groups treated with 25 and 50 mg/kg metformin. Metfromin markedly reduced isoproterenol-induced elevation of TLR4, myeloid differentiation protein 88 (MyD88), tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-a), and interleukin 6 (IL-) mRNA levels. 6) in cardiac tissues. Similar changes were also observed in serum levels of TNF-a and IL-6. However, the lower doses of 25 and 50 mg/kg were more effective than 100 mg/kg. Phosphorylated AMPKa (p-AMPK) in the myocardium was significantly elevated by 25 mg/kg metformin, slightly by 50 mg/kg, but not by 100 mg/kg. Chronic pretreatment with metformin reduces post-myocardial infarction cardiac dysfunction and suppresses inflammatory responses, possibly through inhibition of TLR4 activities. This mechanism can be considered as a target to protect the infarcted myocardium.\n",
      "Garcinielliptone FC (GFC) isolated from hexane fraction seed extract of the species Platonia insignis Mart. It is widely used in traditional medicine to treat skin diseases in humans and animals, and a decoction of the seeds has been used to treat diarrhea and inflammatory diseases. However, there is no research on the effects of GFCs on the central nervous system of rodents. The present study aimed to evaluate the effects of GFCs at doses of 25, 50 or 75 mg/kg on seizure parameters to determine their anticonvulsant activity and its effects on amino acid levels (r-aminobutyric acid (GABA ), glutamine, aspartate and glutathione). as well as on acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity in mouse hippocampus after seizures. GFC produced increased latency to first seizure, at doses of 25 mg/kg (20.12 + 2.20 min), 50 mg/kg (20.95 + 2.21 min), or 75 mg/kg (23.43 + 1.99 min) compared to seized mice. Furthermore, the GABA content of the hippocampus of mice treated with GFC75 plus P400 showed an increase of 46.90% compared to the seized mice. In aspartate, glutamine and glutamate levels detected a decrease of 5.21%, 13.55% and 21.80%, respectively in hippocampal mice treated with GFC75 plus P400 compared to seized mice. Hippocampal mice treated with GFC75 plus P400 showed increased AChE activity (63.30%) compared to seized mice. The results indicate that GFC may exert anticonvulsant activity and reduce the frequency of onset of pilocarpine-induced status epilepticus, as demonstrated by increased latency to first seizure and decreased mortality rate. animals. In conclusion, our data suggest that GFC could influence epileptogenesis and promote anticonvulsant actions in the pilocarpine model by modulating GABA and glutamate contents as well as AChE activity in the hippocampus of seizure mice. This compound may be useful in producing neuronal protection and may be considered an anticonvulsant agent.\n",
      "A new genetic disease resulting from a mutation in THRA, encoding the thyroid hormone a1 receptor (TRa1), has been identified. Affected children have an elevated serum T3:T4 ratio and variable degrees of intellectual deficit and constipation, but present with consistently severe skeletal dysplasia. In an effort to improve developmental delay and alleviate symptoms of hypothyroidism, patients receive varying doses and durations of treatment at T4, but responses have been inconsistent to date. Thra1(PV/+) mice express a potent dominant-negative TRa1 mutant similar to affected individuals and thus represent an excellent disease model. We hypothesized that Thra1(PV/+) mice could be used to predict the skeletal outcome of human THRA mutations and determine whether prolonged treatment with a supraphysiological dose of T4 improves skeletal abnormalities. Adult female Thra1 (PV/+) mice exhibited small size, obviously abnormal bone morphology, but normal bone strength despite high bone mass. Although T4 treatment suppressed TSH secretion, it had no effect on skeletal maturation, linear growth, or bone mineralization, demonstrating profound tissue resistance to thyroid hormone. Despite this, prolonged T4 treatment abnormally increased bone stiffness and strength, suggesting the potential for long-term adverse consequences. Our studies establish that TRa1 plays an essential role in the developing and adult skeleton and predict that patients with different THRA mutations will exhibit variable responses to T4 treatment, which depend on the severity of the causative mutation.\n",
      "Lithium, an effective antipsychotic, induces nephrogenic diabetes insipidus (NDI) in 40% of patients. The decreased ability to concentrate urine is likely due to lithium's acute disruption of the cAMP pathway and chronic reduction in urea transporter (UT-A1) and water channel expression. (AQP2) in the inner medulla. Targeting an alternative signaling pathway, such as PKC-mediated signaling, may provide an effective method of treating lithium-induced polyuria. PKC-alpha null mice (PKCa KO) and strain-matched wild-type (WT) controls were treated with lithium for 0, 3, or 5 days. WT mice showed increased urine flow and decreased urine osmolality after 3 and 5 days of treatment, while PKCa KO mice showed no changes in urine flow or concentration. Western blot analysis revealed that AQP2 expression in marrow tissues was reduced after 3 and 5 days in WT mice; however, AQP2 was unchanged in PKCa KO. Similar results were observed with UT-A1 expression. The animals were also treated with lithium for 6 weeks. Lithium-treated WT mice had 19-fold higher urine output, while PKCa KO-treated animals had 4-fold higher urine output. Expression of AQP2 and UT-A1 was reduced in lithium-treated WT animals for 6 weeks, whereas in treated PKCa KO mice, AQP2 was reduced only 2-fold and UT-A1 expression was not affected. Urinary sodium, potassium, and calcium were elevated in lithium-fed WT mice, but not in lithium-fed PKCa KO mice. Our data show that PKCa ablation preserves AQP2 and UT-A1 protein expression and localization in lithium-induced NDI and prevents the development of severe polyuria associated with lithium therapy.\n",
      "Butyrylcholinesterase deficiency is characterized by prolonged apnea after the use of muscle relaxants (suxamethonium or mivacurium) in patients with BCHE gene mutations. We report here a case of prolonged neuromuscular blockade after administration of suxamethonium leading to the discovery of a new BCHE variant (c.695T>A, p.Val204Asp). Inhibition studies, kinetic analyzes and molecular dynamics were undertaken to understand how this mutation disrupts the catalytic triad and determines a “silent” phenotype. The patient's low plasma butyrylcholinesterase activity with butyrylthiocholine (BTC) and benzoylcholine, and the values ​​of dibucaine and fluoride numbers correspond to the heterozygous atypical silent genotype. Electrophoretic analysis of BChE plasma from the proband and his mother showed that the patient has a reduced amount of tetramer enzyme in plasma and minor components of rapidly evolving BChE: monomer, dimer and monomer-albumin conjugate are missing. . Kinetic analysis showed that p.Val204Asp/p.Asp70Gly-p.Ala539Thr BChE displays pure Michaelian behavior with BTC as substrate. The two catalytic parameters Km = 265 μM for BTC, twice that of the atypical enzyme, and a low Vmax are consistent with the absence of activity against suxamethonium. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations showed that the overall effect of the p.Val204Asp mutation is a disruption of the hydrogen bond between Gln223 and Glu441, leading Ser198 and His438 to move away from each other with a subsequent disruption of the functionality of the catalytic triad, regardless of the substrate type. MD also showed that the volume of the enzyme is increased, suggesting a pre-denaturation state. This corresponds to the reduced concentration of the tetrameric enzyme p.Ala204Asp/p.Asp70Gly-p.Ala539Thr in plasma and the fast-moving bands not detectable on electrophoresis gels.\n",
      "The potential protective effect of curcumin, a dietary antioxidant (120 mg/Kg/day for 6 days) against maleate-induced renal damage, was evaluated. Tubular proteinuria and oxidative stress were induced by a single injection of maleate (400 mg/kg) in rats. Maleate-induced renal injury included increased renal vascular resistance and urinary excretion of total protein, glucose, sodium, neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (NGAL), and N-acetyl b-D- glucosaminidase (NAG), an upregulation of kidney injury molecule (KIM). )-1, decreased renal blood flow and claudin-2 expression in addition to tubular cell necrosis and apoptosis over 24 h. Oxidative stress was determined by measuring lipid and protein oxidation and decreased renal Nrf2 levels. Studies were also conducted on LLC-PK1 renal epithelial cells and mitochondria isolated from the kidneys of all experimental groups. Maleate induced cell damage and reactive oxygen species (ROS) production in cultured LLC-PK1 cells. Furthermore, maleate treatment reduced oxygen consumption in ADP-stimulated mitochondria and decreased the respiratory control index when using malate/glutamate as a substrate. Complex I and aconitase activities were also decreased. All the alterations described above were avoided by curcumin. It is concluded that curcumin is capable of attenuating maleate-induced nephropathy in vivo and cell damage in vitro. In vivo protection was associated with prevention of oxidative stress and preservation of mitochondrial oxygen consumption and respiratory complex I activity, and in vitro protection was associated with prevention of ROS production.\n",
      "The present study tested the hypothesis that sepsis-induced leucine (Leu) resistance in skeletal muscle is associated with downregulation of amino acid transporters important in the regulation of Leu flux or impairment of the formation of the Leu-sensitive mTOR-Ragulator complex. Sepsis in adult male rats decreased basal protein synthesis in the gastrocnemius, associated with reduced mTOR activation, as indicated by decreased phosphorylation of 4E-BP1 and S6K1. The ability of oral Leu to increase protein and mTOR kinase synthesis after 1 hour was largely prevented in sepsis. Sepsis increased the mRNA content of CAT1, LAT2, and SNAT2 two- to fourfold, but only the protein content of CAT1 (20% decrease) differed significantly. Conversely, sepsis decreased proton-assisted amino acid transporter (PAT)-2 mRNA by 60%, but without a coordinated change in PAT2 protein. There was no effect of sepsis or Leu on the protein content of RagA-D, LAMTOR-1 and -2, raptor, Rheb, or mTOR in muscle. Binding of mTOR, PRAS40, and RagC to raptor did not differ between control and septic muscle in the basal state; however, the Leu-induced decrease in Raptor PRAS40 and increase in Raptor RagC observed in control muscle were absent in sepsis. Intracellular Leu concentration increased in septic muscle compared to basal control conditions, and oral Leu further increased intracellular Leu concentration similarly in control and septic rats. Therefore, although alterations in certain amino acid transporters are not associated with the development of sepsis-induced Leu resistance, Leu-stimulated binding of raptor with RagC and recruitment of mTOR/raptor to the endosome-lysosomal compartment may partly explain the incapacity of Leu. to fully activate mTOR and muscle protein synthesis.\n",
      "BACKGROUND: Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infects the lung epithelium where it stimulates the production of many host cytokines associated with disease burden and acute lung injury. Characterization of the host cytokine response to RSV infection, host cytokine regulation, and the impact of RSV-inducible cytokine neutralization during infection were companies in this study. METHODS: A549, primary human small airway epithelial (SAE) cells and wild-type knockout (KO) mice containing interferon-b inducing adapter (Trif) and mitochondrial antiviral signaling protein (Mavs) (KO) were infected with RSV. and cytokine responses were studied by ELISA, multiplex analysis and qPCR. Neutralizing anti-leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) IgG or control IgG was administered to a group of wild-type animals before RSV infection. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: RSV-infected A549 and SAE cells release a network of cytokines, including the newly identified RSV-inducible cytokines LIF, migration inhibitory factor (MIF), stem cell factor (SCF), CCL27, CXCL12 and stem cell growth factor beta (SCGF-b). These RSV-inducible cytokines were also observed in the airways of mice during infection. To identify RSV-inducible cytokine regulation, animals deficient in Mavs and Trif were infected with RSV. In vivo induction of airway IL-1b, IL-4, IL-5, IL-6, IL-12(p40), IFN-g, CCL2, CCL5, CCL3, CXCL1, IP-10/CXCL10, IL-22 , MIG/CXCL9 and MIF were dependent on Mavs expression in mice. Loss of Trif expression in mice altered RSV induction of IL-1b, IL-5, CXCL12, MIF, LIF, CXCL12, and IFN-g . Knockdown of retinoic acid-inducible gene 1 (RIG-I) expression in A549 cells had a greater impact on RSV-inducible cytokines than melanoma differentiation-associated protein 5 (MDA5 ) and the Genetics and Physiology Laboratory 2 (LGP2) and Trif. expression. To assess the role of LIF in the airways during RSV infection, animals were treated with neutralizing anti-LIF IgG, which ameliorated the RSV pathology observed with increased space protein content. airway, apoptosis and airway hyperresponsiveness compared to control IgG treatment. CONCLUSIONS: RSV infection in the epithelium induces a network of immune factors to counter the infection, mainly in a RIG-I-dependent manner. LIF expression protects the lungs from lung injury and worsening pathology during RSV infection.\n",
      "Androgens have important cardiometabolic actions in men, but their metabolic role in women is unclear. To determine the physiological androgen-dependent actions of androgen receptor (AR) on atherogenesis in female mice, we generated female AR-knockout (ARKO) mice on an atherosclerosis-prone apolipoprotein E (apoE)-deficient background. . After 8 weeks of high-fat diet, but not normal diet, aortic atherosclerosis increased in ARKO females (+59% compared to control apoE-deficient mice with intact AR gene). They also had increased body weight (+18%), body fat percentage (+62%), and hepatic triglyceride levels, reduced insulin sensitivity, and marked atherogenic dyslipidemia (serum cholesterol, +52%). ). Differences in atherosclerosis, body weight, and lipid levels between ARKO and control mice were abolished in mice ovariectomized before puberty, consistent with an AR-mediated protective action of ovarian androgens. Additionally, the AR agonist dihydrotestosterone reduced atherosclerosis (-41%; thoracic aorta), subcutaneous fat mass (-44%), and cholesterol levels (-35%) in ovariectomized mice, reduced hepatocyte lipid accumulation in hepatoma cells in vitro and regulated mRNA expression of hepatic genes is essential for homeostasis lipid. In conclusion, we demonstrate that AR protects against diet-induced atherosclerosis in female mice and propose that this is mediated through modulation of body composition and lipid metabolism.\n",
      "OBJECTIVE: We tested whether 18 polymorphisms in 16 genes (GSTP1, COX2, IL10, EGFR, EGF, FGFR4, CCDN1, VEGFR2, VEGF, CXCR2, IL8, MMP3, ICAM1, ERCC1, RAD51 and XRCC3) would predict survival without disease. (DFS), overall survival (OS), and toxicity in the INT0144 trial, designed to study different postoperative 5-fluorouracil (5-FU)-based chemoradiotherapy (CRT) regimens in locally advanced rectal cancers: arm 1 included 5-FU bolus followed by prolonged venous infusion (PVI) of 5-FU with radiotherapy; arm 2 was induction and concomitant 5-FU PVI with radiotherapy and arm 3 was induction and concomitant 5-FU bolus with radiotherapy. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: DNA from 746 stage II/III rectal patients enrolled in the Southwest Oncology Group (SWOG) Phase III S9304 trial was analyzed. Genomic DNA was extracted from formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tumor tissue. Polymorphisms were analyzed by direct DNA sequencing or polymerase chain reaction restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP). RESULTS: GSTP1-Ile105Val (rs1695) was significantly associated with DFS and OS and its effect did not vary by treatment arm. Five-year DFS and OS were 53% and 58% for G/G patients, 66% and 72% for G/A patients, and 57% and 66% for A/A patients, respectively. In arm 2, the IL8-251A/A (rs4073) genotype was associated with a lower risk of toxicities (P = 0.04). The VEGFR2 H472Q Q/Q (rs1870377) genotype was associated with a higher risk of grade 3 to 5 proximal upper gastrointestinal tract (PUGIT) mucositis (P = 0.04) in arm 2. However, in arm 1, this genotype was associated with a lower risk of PUGIT mucositis (P = 0.004). CONCLUSION:rs1695 may be prognostic in rectal cancer patients treated with adjuvant CRT. rs4073 and rs1870377 may exhibit different associations with toxicity, depending on the 5-FU schedule.\n",
      "Our recent study showed that SAG/RBX2 E3 ubiquitin ligase regulates apoptosis and vasculogenesis by promoting the degradation of NOXA and NF1, and cooperates with Kras to promote lung tumorigenesis by activating NFkappaB and mTOR pathways via degradation targeted tumor suppressor substrates, including IkappaB, DEPTOR. , p21 and p27. Here, we investigated the role of Sag/Rbx2 E3 ligase in cellular senescence and immortalization of mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) and report that Sag is required for proper cell proliferation and Kras-induced immortalization ( G12D). Inactivation of sag by genetic deletion remarkably suppresses cell proliferation by inducing senescence, which is associated with the accumulation of p16, but not p53. Mechanistically, deletion of Sag caused accumulation of Jun-B, a substrate of the Sag-Fbxw7 E3 ligase and a transcription factor that drives p16 transcription. Importantly, senescence triggered by Sag deletion can be largely rescued by simultaneous deletion of Cdkn2a, the gene encoding p16, indicating its causal role. Additionally, Kras-induced immortalization (G12D) can also be abrogated by deletion of Sag via induction of senescence, which is again rescued by simultaneous deletion of Cdkn2a. Finally, we found that deletion of Sag inactivates Kras (G12D) activity and blocks the MAPK signaling pathway, as well as accumulated p16, to induce senescence. Taken together, our results demonstrated that Sag is a Kras-cooperating oncogene (G12D), required for Kras (G12D)-mediated immortalization and transformation, and that targeting the SAG-SCF E3 ligase may therefore have a Therapeutic value for senescence-based cancer treatment.\n",
      "Neuroserpin (NSP) is reported to exert neuroprotective effects in animal models and cerebral ischemic patients; however, the protection mechanism is poorly understood. We thus attempted to confirm the neuroprotective effects of NSP on astrocytes in an ischemic state, then explored the relative mechanisms. Astrocytes from newborn rats were treated with oxygen and glucose deprivation (OGD) followed by reoxygenation (OGD/R). To confirm the neuroprotective effects of NSP, we measured cell survival rate, relative release of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH); we also performed morphological methods, namely Hoechst 33342 staining and Annexin V assay. To explore the potential mechanisms of NSP, nitric oxide (NO) and TNF-alpha release related to NSP administration was measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Proteins related to the NF-kappaB, ERK1/2 and PI3K/Akt pathways were studied by Western blotting. To verify the causal relationship between neuroprotection and NF-kappaB pathway, NF-kappaB pathway inhibitor sc3060 was used to observe the effects of NSP-induced neuroprotection. We found that NSP significantly increased cell survival rate and reduced LDH release in OGD/R-treated astrocytes. It also reduced the release of NO/TNF-alpha. Western blotting showed that the protein levels of p-IKKBalpha/beta and P65 were upregulated by OGD/R treatment and these effects were significantly inhibited by NSP administration. NSP-induced inhibition could be significantly reversed by administration of the NF-kappaB pathway inhibitor sc3060, whereas the expressions of p-ERK1, p-ERK2, and p-AKT were upregulated by the OGD/R treatment; however, their levels remained unchanged by the NSP administration. Our results thus verified the neuroprotective effects of NSP in ischemic astrocytes. Potential mechanisms include inhibition of NO/TNF-alpha release and repression of NF-kappaB signaling pathways. Our data also indicated that NSP has little influence on MAPK and PI3K/Akt pathways.\n",
      "Recent studies have shown that TIPE2 is involved in the development of cancer. However, little is known about TIPE2 in lung cancer. Our study aims to clarify the role of TIPE2 in lung carcinogenesis. We examined TIPE2 expression in squamous cell lung cancer (LSC), small cell lung cancer, and lung adenocarcinoma (AdC) tissues and found that TIPE2 expression was lost in the small cell lung cancer, compared to adjacent non-tumor tissues. Overexpression of TIPE2 significantly inhibited the growth of H446 lung cancer cells in vitro and even suppressed tumor formation in vivo. Flow cytometry analysis revealed that TIPE2 overexpression promoted H446 apoptosis. In TIPE2 overexpressing cells, caspase-3, caspase-9, and Bax were significantly upregulated, while Bcl-2 was downregulated. Additionally, coincident results were shown by immunohistochemistry in nude mouse tumors. TIPE2 inhibited Akt phosphorylation, while promoting P38 phosphorylation, but had no effect on IkBa and ERK pathways. Taken together, TIPE2 promoted apoptosis of lung cancer cells by affecting apoptosis-related molecules caspase-3, caspase-9, Bcl-2 and Bax, possibly via regulation of P38 and Akt pathways, indicating that TIPE2 could be a new marker for lung cancer diagnosis and therapy.\n",
      "P-21-activated kinases (PAKs) are serine/threonine kinases comprising six isoforms divided into two groups, group I (PAK1-3)/group II (PAK4-6) that play an important role in cellular cytoskeletal dynamics , survival, secretion and proliferation and are activated by various stimuli. However, little is known about the ability of PAKs to be activated by gastrointestinal (GI) hormones/neurotransmitters/growth factors. We used rat pancreatic acini to explore the ability of GI hormones/neurotransmitters/growth factors to activate Group-I-PAKs and the signaling cascades involved. Only PAK2 was present in acini. PAK2 was activated by certain pancreatic growth factors [EGF, PDGF, bFGF], by phospholipase-C-activating (PLC) secretagogues [CCK, carbachol, promethazine] and by PKC-activating post-receptor stimulants [TPA]. but not by agents mobilizing only cellular calcium or increasing cyclic AMP. CCK activation of PAK2 required activation of both high and low affinity CCK1 receptor states. It was partially reduced by PKC or Src inhibition, but not by PI3K inhibitors (wortmannin, LY294002) or thapsigargin. IPA-3, which prevents PAK2 binding to small GTPases, partially inhibited PAK2 activation, as well as CCK-induced ERK1/2 activation and CCK- or Bombesin-induced amylase release. This study demonstrates that pancreatic acini have only one I-PAK group, PAK2. CCK and other GI hormones/neurotransmitters/growth factors activate PAK2 via small GTPases (CDC42/Rac1), PKC, and SFK, but not cytosolic calcium or PI3K. CCK activation of PAK2 showed several novel features dependent on both receptor activation states, having PLC- and PKC-dependent/independent components and small GTPase-dependent/independent components. These results show that PAK2 plays an important role in the signaling cascades activated by many pancreatic stimuli that mediate their various physiological/physiological responses and therefore could constitute a promising target for the development of therapies in certain pancreatic disorders such as pancreatitis.\n",
      "Tumor cell senescence induced by genotoxic treatments has recently been shown to be paradoxically linked to the induction of “stemness”. This observation is critical because it directly affects the response of tumors to current chemoradiotherapy regimens. Previously, we showed that after etoposide (ETO) treatment, embryonal carcinoma PA-1 cells underwent p53-dependent upregulation of OCT4A and p21Cip1 (governing self-renewal and regulating the cell cycle inhibition and senescence, respectively). Here we report more details on the relationship between these and other critical regulators of cell fate. ETO-treated PA-1 cells exhibit highly heterogeneous increases in OCT4A and p21Cip1, indicating a misadaptation catastrophe. Knockdown of OCT4A suppresses p21Cip1, alters cell cycle regulation, and subsequently suppresses terminal senescence; Silencing of p21Cip1 did not affect OCT4A expression or cellular phenotype. Expression of SOX2 and NANOG did not change after ETO treatment, suggesting a dissociation of OCT4A from its pluripotency function. Instead, ETO-induced OCT4A was concomitant with AMPK activation, a key component of metabolic stress and autophagy regulation. p16ink4a, the inducer of terminal senescence, underwent autophagic sequestration in the cytoplasm of ETO-treated cells, thereby allowing alternative cell fates. Accordingly, autophagy failure was accompanied by p16ink4a accumulation, nuclear disintegration, and loss of cellular recovery. Together, these results imply that induction of OCT4A following DNA damage in PA-1 cells exerts a cellular stress, rather than self-renewal, function by moderating the expression of p21Cip1, which , alongside AMPK, then helps regulate autophagy. Furthermore, these data indicate that depletion of autophagy, due to persistent DNA damage, drives terminal cellular senescence.\n",
      "BACKGROUND: Millions of people worldwide, especially those living in rural and developing areas, are exposed to harmful levels of inorganic arsenic (iAs) in their drinking water. Exposure to inorganic As during key periods of development is associated with a variety of adverse health effects, including those evident in adulthood. There is considerable interest in identifying the molecular mechanisms that link early exposure to iAs to the development of these latent diseases, particularly in relation to cancer. OBJECTIVES: This work summarizes research on the molecular mechanisms that underlie the increased risk of cancer development in adulthood associated with early exposure to iAs. DISCUSSION:Epigenetic reprogramming that results in functional changes in gene expression, cancer stem cell development, and immunomodulation are plausible underlying mechanisms by which early exposure to iAs causes latent carcinogenic effects. CONCLUSIONS: Growing evidence links exposure to iAs early in life and the development of cancer later in life. Future research should include animal studies that address mechanistic hypotheses and studies in human populations that integrate early life exposure, molecular alterations, and latent disease consequences.\n",
      "BACKGROUND: Most hepatocellular carcinomas (HCCs) are diagnosed at an advanced stage. The prognostic value of serum tumor markers alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) and des-gamma-carboxy prothrombin (DCP) is limited. The aim of our study is to evaluate the diagnostic value of serum growth factors, apoptotic and inflammatory mediators in cirrhotic patients with and without HCC. METHODS: Serum samples were collected from cirrhotic potential liver transplant (LTx) patients with (n = 61) and without HCC (n = 78) as well as from healthy controls (HC; n = 39). Serum concentrations of CRP, neopterin and IL-6 as markers of inflammation and thrombopoietin (TPO), GCSF, FGF basic and VEGF, HMGB1, CK-18 (M65) and CK18 fragment (M30) and a panel of proinflammatory chemokines ( CCL2, CCL3, CCL4, CCL5, CXCL5 and IL-8) were measured. Chi-square, Fisher exact, Mann-Whitney, ROC curve, and stepwise logistic regression analyzes were applied. RESULTS: Patients with HCC had higher serum TPO and chemokine levels (P<0.001 for TPO, CCL4, CCL5, and CXCL5) and lower CCL2 levels (P=0.008) than cirrhotic patients without HCC. Stepwise multivariate regression analysis for significant parameters showed that among the studied parameters, CCL4 and CCL5 (P=0.001) are diagnostic markers of HCC. Serum levels of TPO and chemokines were lower, while M30 was significantly higher in cirrhotic patients than in HC. CONCLUSIONS: Elevated serum levels of inflammatory chemokines such as CCL4 and CCL5 in the serum of cirrhotic patients indicate the presence of HCC.\n",
      "Genome-wide association studies have identified genomic loci whose single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) predispose to prostate cancer (PCa). However, the mechanisms of most of these variants are largely unknown. We integrated chromatin immunoprecipitation-coupled sequencing and microarray expression profiling in TMPRSS2-ERG gene rearrangement-positive DUCaP cells with the GWAS PCa risk SNP catalog to identify SNPs of susceptibility to disease located in functional androgen receptor binding sites (ARBS). Among the 48 at-risk SNPs in the GWAS index and 3,917 linked SNPs, 80 were found located in ARBS. Among these, rs11891426:T>G in an intron of the melanophilin (MLPH) gene was within a putative novel auxiliary AR-binding motif, which is enriched in the vicinity of canonical androgen-responsive elements. T>G exchange attenuated ARBS transcriptional activity in an AR reporter gene assay. MLPH expression in primary prostate tumors was significantly lower in those carrying the G allele compared to the T allele and was significantly correlated with AR protein. A higher melanophilin level in the prostate tissue of patients with a favorable CaP risk profile indicates a tumor suppressive effect. These results reveal a hidden link between AR and a putative functional PCa risk SNP, whose allelic alteration affects androgen regulation of its host gene MLPH.\n",
      "BACKGROUND: Studies in mice have shown that PPARa is an important regulator of lipid metabolism in the liver and a key transcription factor involved in the adaptive response to fasting. However, much less is known about the role of PPARa in the human liver. METHODS: Here we set out to investigate PPARa function in human liver via genome-wide gene regulation analysis in human liver slices treated with the PPARa agonist Wy14643. RESULTS: Quantitative PCR indicated that PPARa is well expressed in human liver and human liver slices and that the classical targets of PPARa, PLIN2, VLDLR, ANGPTL4, CPT1A and PDK4, are strongly induced by PPARa activation . Transcriptomic analysis indicated that 617 genes were upregulated and 665 genes were downregulated by PPARa activation (q value < 0.05). Many genes induced by PPARa activation were involved in lipid metabolism (ACSL5, AGPAT9, FADS1, SLC27A4), xenobiotic metabolism (POR, ABCC2, CYP3A5) or unfolded protein response, whereas most genes downregulated were involved in immune pathways. Among the genes most repressed upon PPARa activation were several chemokines (e.g. CXCL9-11, CCL8, CX3CL1, CXCL6), genes induced by interferon g (e.g. IFITM1, IFIT1, IFIT2, IFIT3) and many other genes related to the immune system (e.g. TLR3). , NOS2 and LCN2). Comparative analysis of gene regulation by Wy14643 between human liver slices and primary human hepatocytes showed that the negative regulation of gene expression by PPARa is much better captured by liver slices than by primary hepatocytes. Notably, PPARa activation markedly suppressed immunity/inflammation-related genes in human liver slices, but not in primary hepatocytes. Finally, several novel putative PPARa target genes were identified, which were commonly induced by PPARa activation in both human liver model systems, including TSKU, RHOF, CA12, and VSIG10L. CONCLUSION: Our article demonstrates the suitability and superiority of human liver slices over primary hepatocytes to study the functional role of PPARa in human liver. Our data highlight the major role of PPARa in the regulation of hepatic lipid and xenobiotic metabolism in human liver and reveal a marked immunosuppressive/anti-inflammatory effect of PPARa in human liver slices that could be therapeutically relevant for fatty liver disease. non-alcoholic.\n",
      "Centrosomal protein 55 (CEP55) is a cell cycle regulator involved in the development of certain cancers. However, the characteristics of CEP55 expression and its clinical/prognostic significance are unclear in human epithelial ovarian carcinoma (EOC). Therefore, we investigated the expression and clinicopathological significance of CEP55 in EOC patients and its role in regulating the invasion and metastasis of ovarian cell lines. The expression levels of CEP55 mRNA and protein were detected by quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR), Western blotting, and immunohistochemistry (IHC). Potential associations of CEP55 expression scores with clinical parameters and patient survival were evaluated. CEP55 function was further investigated using RNA interference, wound healing assay, Transwell assay, immunofluorescence analysis, qRT-PCR, and Western blot. CEP55 was significantly upregulated in ovarian cancer cell lines and lesions compared to normal cells and adjacent non-cancerous ovarian tissues. In all 213 EOC samples, CEP55 protein levels were positively correlated with clinical stage (P < 0.001), lymph node metastasis (P < 0.001), intraperitoneal metastasis (P < 0.001), tumor recurrence (P < 0.001 ), degree of differentiation (P < 0.001), residual tumor size (P < 0.001), ascites see tumor cells (P = 0.020) and serum CA153 level (P < 0.001). Additionally, patients with aberrant CEP55 protein expression tended to receive neoadjuvant chemotherapy (P < 0.001) and cytoreductive surgery (P = 0.020). In contrast, no significant correlation was detected between protein levels and patient age, histological type, or serum levels of CA125, CA199, CA724, NSE, CEA, and b-HCG. Patients with high CEP55 protein expression had shorter overall survival and disease-free survival than those with low CEP55 expression. Multivariate analysis implicated CEP55 as an independent prognostic indicator for EOC patients. Furthermore, downregulation of CEP55 in ovarian cancer cells remarkably inhibited cell motility and invasion. Aberrant CEP55 expression may predict adverse clinical outcomes in EOC patients and play an important role in regulating ovarian cancer cell invasion. Thus, CEP55 may serve as a prognostic marker and therapeutic target for EOC.\n",
      "The genomic profiles of gastroenteropancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (GEP-NETs) are still insufficiently understood and the genetic alterations associated with drug responses have not been studied. Here, we performed whole exome sequencing of 12 GEP-NETs from patients enrolled in a nonrandomized, open-label, single-center phase II study for pazopanib, and integrated our results with previously published pancreas results. (n = 12) and the small intestine. NET (n = 50). The average number of somatic mutations in each case varied widely, from 20 to 4,682. Among the 12 GEP-NETs, ​​eight had mutations in more than one cancer-related gene, including TP53, CNBD1, RB1, APC, BCOR, BRAF, CTNNB1, EGFR. , EP300, ERBB3, KDM6A, KRAS, MGA, MLL3, PTEN, RASA1, SMARCB1, SPEN, TBC1D12 and VHL. TP53 was recurrently mutated in three cases, while CNBD1 and RB1 mutations were identified in two cases. Three GEP-NET patients with TP53 mutations demonstrated a durable response and one small intestinal grade (G) 1 NET patient with a BRAF V600E mutation showed progression after pazopanib treatment. We found BRAF V600E (rectal G1 NET and two colon G3 NET) and BRAF G593S (pancreatic G2 NET) missense mutations (9.1%) in an independent cohort of 44 rectal GEP-NETs (n = 26), of the colon. (n = 7), pancreas (n = 4), small intestine (n = 3), stomach (n = 3) and appendix (n = 1) by Sanger sequencing. All tumor samples were obtained before chemotherapy. In conclusion, the BRAF V600E mutation is likely to cause resistance to pazopanib, but could be a potentially exploitable mutation in metastatic GEP-NET patients.\n",
      "BACKGROUND: Transgelin is an actin-binding protein that promotes motility in normal cells. Although the role of transgelin in cancer is controversial, a number of studies have shown that high levels correlate with aggressive tumor behavior, advanced stage, and poor prognosis. Here, we sought to more directly determine the role of transgelin by determining whether experimental manipulation of transgelin levels in colorectal cancer (CRC) cells results in changes in metastatic potential in vivo. METHODS: Isogenic CRC cell lines that differ in transgelin expression were characterized using in vitro growth and invasiveness assays and an experimental mouse tail vein metastasis assay. The downstream effects of transgelin overexpression were investigated by gene expression profiling and quantitative PCR. RESULTS: Stable overexpression of transgelin in RKO cells, which have low endogenous levels, led to increased invasiveness, growth at low density, and growth in soft agar. Overexpression also led to an increase in the number and size of lung metastases in the mouse tail vein injection model. Similarly, attenuation of transgelin expression in HCT116 cells, which have high endogenous levels, decreased metastasis in the same model. Investigation of mRNA expression patterns showed that overexpression of transgelin altered the levels of approximately 250 other transcripts, with overrepresentation of genes that affect the function of actin or other proteins of the cytoskeleton. Changes included increases in HOOK1, SDCCAG8, ENAH/Mena, and TNS1 and decreases in EMB, BCL11B, and PTPRD. CONCLUSIONS: Increases or decreases in transgelin levels have reciprocal effects on tumor cell behavior, with higher expression promoting metastasis. Chronic overexpression influences steady-state mRNA levels for metastasis-related genes.\n",
      "OBJECTIVE:Complement factor I (CFI) plays an important role in complement activation pathways and is known to affect the development of uveitis. The present study was carried out to investigate the existence of an association between CFI genetic polymorphisms and Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada (VKH) syndrome. METHODS:A total of 100 patients diagnosed with VKH syndrome and 300 healthy controls were recruited for the study. Two milliliters of peripheral blood was collected into a sterile anticoagulant tube. CFI-rs7356506 polymorphisms were genotyped using Sequenom MassARRAY technology. Allele and genotype frequencies were compared between patients and controls using a χ(2) test. Analyzes were stratified by recurrent status, complicated cataract status, and steroid sensitivity status. RESULTS: No significant association was found between CFI-rs7356506 polymorphisms and VKH syndrome. However, patients with recurrent VKH syndrome had lower frequencies of G allele and GG homozygosity in CFI-rs7356506 compared to controls (p = 0.016, odds ratio [OR] = 0.429, confidence interval [CI ] at 95% = 0.212-0.871; p=0.014, OR=0.364, 95% CI=0.158-0.837, respectively). Additionally, there was a significant decrease in G allele and GG homozygosity frequencies in CFI-rs7356506 in VKH syndrome patients with complicated cataract compared to controls (p < 0.001, OR = 0.357, 95% CI=0.197-0.648; p<0.001, OR=0.273, 95% CI=0.135-0.551, respectively). Nevertheless, no significant association with VKH syndrome patients in steroid-sensitive statuses was detected for CFI-rs7356506 polymorphisms. CONCLUSIONS:Our results indicate that CFI polymorphisms are not significantly associated with VKH syndrome; nevertheless, we identified a trend for the association of CFI-7356506 with VKH syndrome that depends on recurrent status and complicated cataract status but not on steroid-sensitive status.\n",
      "Serum amyloid A (SAA) is a highly conserved acute phase protein that is primarily secreted by hepatocytes. However, its role in liver injury and fibrogenesis has not yet been elucidated. In this study, we determined the effects of SAA on hepatic stellate cells (HSCs), the major fibrogenic cell type in the liver. Potently activated serum amyloid A kinase IkappaB, c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), Erk and Akt and enhanced NF-kappaB-dependent luciferase activity in primary human and rat HSCs. Serum amyloid A induced transcription of MCP-1, RANTES, and MMP9 in an NF-kappaB- and JNK-dependent manner. Blocking NF-kappaB revealed the cytotoxic effects of SAA in primary HSCs with signs of apoptosis such as caspase 3 and PARP cleavage and annexin V staining. Serum amyloid A showed induced HSC proliferation, which was dependent on the activity of JNK, Erk, and Akt. In primary hepatocytes, SAA also activated MAP kinases, but did not induce significant cell death after NF-kappaB inhibition. In two models of hepatic fibrogenesis, CCl4 treatment and bile duct ligation, hepatic SAA1 and SAA3 mRNA levels were markedly increased. In conclusion, SAA could modulate liver fibrogenic responses in positive and negative ways by inducing inflammation, proliferation and cell death of HSCs.\n",
      "Plants maintain pools of pluripotent stem cells that allow them to constantly produce new tissues and organs. Stem cell homeostasis in shoot and root tips depends on negative regulation by ligand-receptor pairs of the CLE peptide and leucine-rich repeat receptor-like kinase (LRR-RLK) families. However, regulation of the cambium, the stem cell niche necessary for lateral growth of shoots and roots, is poorly characterized. We show here that the LRR-RLK MOL1 is necessary for cambium homeostasis in Arabidopsis thaliana. By employing promoter reporter lines, we reveal that MOL1 is active in a domain distinct from the positively acting CLE41/PXY signaling module domain. In particular, we show that MOL1 acts opposite the CLE41/PXY module and that changing the domain or expression level of MOL1 results in disruption of cambium organization. Highlighting the discrete roles of MOL1 and PXY, the two LRR-RLKs are not capable of replacing each other when their expression domains are interchanged. Furthermore, MOL1, but not PXY, is able to fill the CLV1 deficiency in the shoot apical meristem. By identifying genes misexpressed in mol1 mutants, we demonstrate that MOL1 represses genes associated with ethylene and jasmonic acid stress-related hormone signaling pathways that play known roles in coordinating lateral growth from the stem of Arabidopsis. Our results provide evidence that common regulatory mechanisms in different plant stem cell niches are adapted to specific niche analyses and highlight the importance of complex spatial organization of intercellular signaling cascades for strictly bidirectional tissue production.\n",
      "PURPOSE: Although the existence of cancer stem cells (CSCs) in adenoid cystic carcinoma (ACC) has been proposed, lack of testing for their propagation and uncertainty regarding molecular markers have prevented their characterization. Our goal was to isolate CSC from ACC and provide insight into the signaling pathways that support their propagation. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: To isolate CSCs from ACCs and characterize them, we used cell culture supplemented with ROCK inhibitor, immunomagnetic cell sorting, and in vitro/in vivo assays for CSC viability and tumorigenicity. RESULTS: We identified ACC CD133-positive CSCs that expressed NOTCH1 and SOX10, formed spheroids, and initiated tumors in nude mice. CD133(+)ACC cells produced activated NOTCH1 (N1ICD) and generated CD133(-) cells that expressed JAG1 as well as the neuronal differentiation factors NR2F1, NR2F2, and p27Kip1. Knockdowns of NOTCH1, SOX10, and their common effector FABP7 negatively affected each other, inhibited spheroidogenesis, and induced cell death, highlighting their essential roles in CSC maintenance. The downstream effects of FABP7 knockdown included suppression of a broad spectrum of genes involved in proliferation, ribosome biogenesis, and metabolism. Among the NOTCH1/FABP7 targets linked to proliferation, we identified SKP2 and its substrate p27Kip1. A g-secretase inhibitor, DAPT, selectively depleted CD133(+) cells, suppressed N1ICD and SKP2, induced p27Kip1, inhibited ACC growth in vivo, and sensitized CD133(+) cells. to radiation. CONCLUSIONS: These results establish in the majority of ACCs the presence of a previously uncharacterized population of CD133(+) cells with neural stem properties, which are driven by SOX10, NOTCH1 and FABP7. The sensitivity of these cells to Notch inhibition and their dependence on SKP2 provide new opportunities for ACC-targeted therapies.\n",
      "The enzyme FASN (fatty acid synthase) is potentially linked to hypertension and metabolic dysfunction. FASN is highly expressed in the human placenta. We aimed to investigate the relationship between circulating FASN and blood pressure, maternal metabolism and newborn parameters in healthy pregnant women. Circulating FASN was assessed in 115 asymptomatic pregnant women during the second trimester of gestation, along with C-peptide, fasting blood glucose and insulin, postload glucose lipids, HMW-adiponectin, and blood pressure. arterial (the latter was assessed at each trimester of gestation). At birth, newborns and placentas were weighed. FASN expression could also be evaluated in 80 placentas. Higher circulating FASN was associated with lower systolic blood pressure (SBP), more favorable metabolic phenotype (lower fasting glucose and insulin, postload glucose, HbAc1, HOMA-IR, and C-peptide), and weight placental and at birth lower (all p < 0.05 to p < 0.001). Placental FASN expression was positively related to circulating FASN (p < 0.005) and negatively related to placental weight (p < 0.05). Our observations suggest a physiological role for placental FASN in human pregnancy. Future studies will determine whether circulating FASN of placental origin actually regulates placental and fetal growth and (thus) has a favorable influence on insulin sensitivity and blood pressure of the pregnant mother.\n",
      "The role of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor α (PPARα)-mediated metabolic remodeling in cardiac adaptation to hypoxia has not yet been defined. Here, mice were housed in hypoxia for 3 weeks before in vivo contractile function was measured by cine MRI. In isolated and perfused hearts, energy was measured using (31)P magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS), and glycolysis and fatty acid oxidation were measured using labeling [(3)H]. Compared to a chow-fed normoxic control mouse heart, hypoxia decreased PPARa expression, fatty acid oxidation, and mitochondrial uncoupling protein 3 (UCP3) levels, while increasing glycolysis. , all of which served to maintain normal ATP concentrations ([ATP]) and thus, ejection fractions. A high-fat diet increased cardiac PPARa expression, fatty acid oxidation, and UCP3 levels with decreased glycolysis. Hypoxia could not modify the elevated PPARa expression or reverse the metabolic changes caused by the high-fat diet, resulting in a significant decrease in [ATP] and contractile function. Hypoxia-induced adaptive metabolic changes in control mouse hearts already occurred in PPARa-deficient (PPARa(-/-)) mouse hearts and maintained function in hypoxia despite an inability to carry out remodeling subsequent metabolism. We conclude that a decrease in cardiac PPARa expression is essential for adaptive metabolic remodeling during hypoxia, but is prevented by dietary fat.-Cole, M. A., Abd Jamil, A. H., Heather, L.

      "Although many advantageous roles of cisplatin (cis-diamminedichloroplatin (II), CDDP) have been reported in cancer treatment, the immunomodulatory roles of cisplatin in phenotypic and functional alterations of dendritic cells (DCs) are poorly understood. Here, we investigated the effect of cisplatin on DC functionality and changes in signaling pathways activated upon toll-like receptor (TLR) stimulation. Cisplatin-treated DCs downregulated the expression of cell surface molecules (CD80, CD86, MHC class I and II) and upregulated endocytic capacity in a dose-dependent manner. Upon stimulation with various TLR agonists, cisplatin-treated DCs showed markedly increased IL-10 production through activation of p38 MAPK and NF-kappaB signaling pathways without altering TNF-alpha levels and IL-12p70, indicating cisplatin-mediated induction of tolerogenic DCs. This effect depended on the production of IL-10 from DCs, because neither DCs isolated from IL-10-/- mice nor DCs neutralized by IL-10 generated tolerogenic DCs. Interestingly, DCs co-treated with cisplatin and lipopolysaccharide (LPS) exhibited reduced immunostimulatory capacity to induce the proliferation of Th1 and Th17-type T cells; instead, these DCs contributed to Th2-type T cell immunity. Furthermore, in vitro and in vivo investigations revealed a unique T cell population, IL-10-producing CD3+CD4+LAG-3+CD49b+CD25-Foxp3-Tr1 cells, which was significantly increased without altering the population of Foxp3+ regulatory T lymphocytes. Taken together, our results suggest that cisplatin induces immunosuppressive tolerogenic DCs under TLR agonist-induced inflammatory conditions via abundant IL-10 production, thereby directing Th cell differentiation toward Th2 and Tr1 cells. This relationship could give cancer cells the ability to evade the immune system.\n",
      "BACKGROUND: Sorafenib, a kinase inhibitor active against various solid tumors, induces oxidative stress and ferroptosis, a novel form of oxidative necrosis, in certain cancer cells. Clinically applicable biomarkers reflecting the impact of sorafenib on redox metabolism of cancer cells are lacking. METHODS: We used gene expression microarrays, real-time PCR, immunoblotting, protein-specific ELISA, and reporter constructs of genes encoding the enzyme luciferase to study the response of a sorafenib cancer cell panel. Tumor explants prepared from hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) surgical specimens and serum samples obtained from HCC patients receiving sorafenib were also used. RESULTS: We observed that metallothionein-1 (MT1) family genes are induced in the HCC Huh7 cell line exposed to sorafenib. Sorafenib increased MT1G mRNA expression in a panel of human cancer cells, an effect that was not observed with eight other clinically approved kinase inhibitors. We identified the minimal region of the MT1G promoter that confers inducibility by sorafenib to a 133 base pair region containing an antioxidant response element (ARE) and showed the essential role of the transcription factor NRF2 (Nuclear factor erythroid 2 -Related Factor 2). . We examined the clinical relevance of our results by analyzing the regulation of MT1G in five tumor explants prepared from surgical HCC samples. Finally, we showed that MT1 protein levels increased in the serum of some HCC patients receiving sorafenib and found an association with reduced overall survival. CONCLUSION: These results indicate that MT1 constitutes a suitable biomarker to explore the impact of sorafenib on the redox metabolism of cancer cells.\n",
      "Chromosomal instability (CIN) is associated with poor survival and treatment outcomes in a number of malignancies. Despite this correlation, CIN can also lead to growth disadvantages. Here, we show that simultaneous overexpression of the mitotic checkpoint protein Mad2 with Kras (G12D) or Her2 in adult mouse mammary glands results in overactivation of the mitotic checkpoint and a delay in tumor appearance. Time-lapse imaging of organotypic cultures and pathological analysis before tumor establishment reveals error-prone mitosis, mitotic arrest, and cell death. Nevertheless, Mad2 expression persists and increases karyotype complexity in Kras tumors. Facing selective pressure of oncogene removal, Mad2-positive tumors have a higher frequency of development of persistent subclones that avoid remission and continue to grow.\n",
      "BACKGROUND:Chronic alcohol consumption leads to loss of white adipose tissue (WAT), but the mechanisms underlying this lipodystrophy are not fully understood. This study tested the hypothesis that reduced WAT mass in chronically alcohol-fed mice is associated with decreased protein synthesis specifically linked to impaired mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) function. ). METHODS: Adult male mice were fed an alcohol-containing liquid diet for 24 weeks or an isocaloric isonizotized control diet. In vivo protein synthesis was determined at this time point, and then epididymal WAT (eWAT) was excised for analysis of signal transduction pathways essential for controlling protein synthesis and degradation. RESULTS: While chronic alcohol feeding decreased whole body and eWAT mass, this was associated with a discordant increase in protein synthesis in eWAT. This increase was not associated with altered phosphorylation of mTOR, 4E-BP1, Akt, or PRAS40. Instead, a selective increase in the phosphorylation of S6K1 and its downstream substrates, S6 and eIF4B, was detected in alcohol-fed mice. Alcohol also increased eEF2K phosphorylation and decreased eEF2 phosphorylation, consistent with increased translation elongation. Alcohol increased the phosphorylation of Atg12-5, LC3B-I and -II and ULK1 S555, suggesting increased autophagy, while markers of apoptosis (cleaved caspase-3 and -9 and PARP) were unchanged. Lipolytic enzymes (ATGL and HSL phosphorylation) were increased and lipogenic regulators (PPARgamma and C/EBPalpha) were decreased in eWAT by alcohol. Although alcohol increased TNF-alpha, IL-6, and IL-1beta mRNA, no changes in key components of the NLRP3 inflammasome (NLRP3, ACS, and cleaved caspase-1) was not detected, suggesting that alcohol did not increase pyroptosis. Plasma insulin did not differ between groups. CONCLUSIONS: These results demonstrate that the alcohol-induced decrease in total body fat results in part from the activation of autophagy in eWAT, with protein synthesis being increased and mediated by the specific increase in activity of S6K1.\n",
      "In the central nervous system, glioma is the most common primary brain tumor. Diffuse migration and rapid proliferation are the main obstacles to successful treatment. Gartanin, a natural xanthone from mangosteen, suppressed proliferation, migration, and colony formation in a time- and concentration-dependent manner in T98G glioma cells, but not in normal mouse HT22 neuronal cells. Gartanine, at low micromole, led to an arrest of the cell cycle in G1 phase accompanied by an inhibition of the expression level of the G1 cell cycle regulatory proteins, cyclin D1, while an increase in the expression level of the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p27Kip1. Furthermore, the secretion and activity of matrix metalloproteinases 2/9 (MMP-2/-9) were significantly suppressed in gartanine-treated T98G cells, and this might result from the modulation of the protein signaling pathway. Mitogen-activated kinases (MAPKs) in T98G glioma. cells. Furthermore, gartanine significantly induced autophagy in T98G cells and an increase in punctate fluorescence of GFP-LC3 accompanied by an increase in the expression level of Beclin 1 and LC3-II, while suppressing the expression level of p62. Gartanine treatment resulted in obvious inhibition of PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling pathway, which is important in modulating autophagy. Notably, gartanine-mediated antiviability was significantly abrogated by autophagy inhibitors, including 3-methyladenine (3-MA) ​​and chloroquine (CQ). These results indicate that the anti-proliferation effect of gartanine in T98G cells is most likely due to autophagy-modulated cell cycle arrest, which is regulated by the PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling pathway, while l The anti-migration effect is most likely due to the suppression of MMP-2. /-9 activity involved in the MAPK signaling pathway.\n",
      "Epigenetic anticancer drugs such as histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors have been combined with existing anticancer drugs to achieve synergistic or additive effects. In the present study, we found that a very low concentration of depsipeptide, an HDAC inhibitor, potentiated the antitumor activity of 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) in a human colon cancer cell model using HCT cells. -116, HT29 and SW48 via inhibition of colony forming capacity or cell viability. Exposure to a combination of 5-FU (1.75 uM) and 1 nM depsipeptide for 24 and 48 h resulted in a 3- to 4-fold increase in activated caspase-3/7, while 5-FU alone failed to activate caspase-3. /7. Subsequent microarray and gene ontology analyzes revealed that, compared to 5-FU or depsipeptide alone, the combined treatment of 5-FU and depsipeptide upregulated genes related to cell death and the apoptotic process. consistent with inhibition of colony formation and activation of caspase-3/7. . These analyzes indicated marked upregulation of antigen processing and peptide or polysaccharide antigen presentation via the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class (GO: 0002504) and the MHC protein complex (GO : 0042611). Compared to vehicle controls, cells treated with the combination of 5-FU and depsipeptide showed a marked induction (3- to 8.5-fold) in the expression of MHC class II genes, but not MHC genes. Furthermore, our global gene expression analysis, focusing on genes involved in the molecular regulation of MHC class II genes, showed an enhancement of pro-apoptotic PCAF and CIITA after the combination of 5-FU and depsipeptide. These results may indicate a closer relationship between the elevation of MHC class II expression and cell apoptosis induced by the combination of depsipeptide and 5-FU. To our knowledge, this is the first study to report that the combination of 5-FU and depsipeptide induces apoptosis of human colon cancer cells in a concerted manner with the induction of MHC gene expression of class II.\n",
      "CD4(+) T cells that produce IFN-g are the host's source of protective IL-10 during primary infection with a number of different pathogens, including Plasmodium spp. The fate of these CD4(+)IFN-g(+)IL-10(+) T lymphocytes after the elimination of a primary infection and their subsequent influence on the evolution of repeated infections are, however, currently unknown. In this study, using IFN-g yellow fluorescent protein (YFP) and IL-10-GFP double reporter mice, we show that CD4(+)YFP(+)GFP(+) T cells induced by primary infection with malaria have limited memory. potential, do not stably express IL-10 and are disproportionately lost from the memory population of Ag-experienced CD4(+) T cells during the post-infection maintenance phase. CD4(+)YFP(+)GFP(+) T cells generally exhibited a short-lived effector T cell phenotype rather than effector memory T cells after infection and expressed high levels of PD-1, Lag-3 and TIGIT, indicating cellular exhaustion. Consistently, surviving CD4(+)YFP(+)GFP(+) T cell-derived cells were unresponsive and failed to proliferate during the early phase of secondary infection. In contrast, CD4(+)YFP(+)GFP(-) T cell-derived cells grew rapidly and upregulated IL-10 expression during secondary infection. Accordingly, CD4(+) T cells were the main producers of an accelerated and amplified IL-10 response during the early stage of secondary malaria infection. Notably, IL-10 exerted quantitatively stronger regulatory effects on innate T cell and CD4(+) cell responses during primary and secondary infections, respectively. The results of this study significantly improve our understanding of the durability of IL-10-producing CD4(+) T cells after infection and provide insight into how IL-10 may help optimize parasite control and to prevent immune-mediated pathologies during repeated malaria infections. .\n",
      "Prostate cancer is the most common cancer among men in developed countries and is a target for risk reduction strategies. The effects of alcohol consumption on prostate cancer incidence and survival remain unclear, potentially due to methodological limitations of observational studies. In this study, we investigated the associations of genetic variants in alcohol-metabolizing genes with prostate cancer incidence and survival. We analyzed data from 23,868 men with prostate cancer and 23,051 controls from 25 studies within the International PRACTICAL Consortium. Study-specific associations of 68 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in 8 alcohol-metabolizing genes (alcohol dehydrogenases (ADH) and aldehyde dehydrogenases (ALDH)) with prostate cancer diagnosis and prostate cancer-specific mortality prostate, by grade, were evaluated using logistic measures and Cox regression models, respectively. Data from the 25 studies were meta-analyzed using fixed and random effects models. We found little evidence that variants in alcohol-metabolizing genes were associated with prostate cancer diagnosis. Four variants in two genes passed the multiple testing threshold for associations with prostate cancer mortality in fixed effects meta-analyses. SNPs within ALDH1A2 associated with prostate cancer mortality were rs1441817 (fixed effects hazard ratio, HRfixed = 0.78; 95% confidence interval (95% CI): 0.66, 0 .91; p-values ​​= 0.002); rs12910509, HRfixed = 0.76; 95% CI: 0.64, 0.91; p-values ​​= 0.003); and rs8041922 (HRfixed = 0.76; 95% CI: 0.64,0.91; p-values ​​= 0.002). These SNPs were in linkage disequilibrium with each other. In ALDH1B1, rs10973794 (HRfixed = 1.43; 95% CI: 1.14,1.79; p-values ​​= 0.002) was associated with prostate cancer mortality in men with prostate cancer low grade. These results suggest that alcohol consumption is unlikely to affect the incidence of prostate cancer, but could influence the progression of the disease.\n",
      "Adiponectin is an adipocyte-derived adipokine with potent antidiabetic, anti-inflammatory, and antiatherogenic activity. Long-term high-fat diet leads to body weight gain, adiposity, other inflammatory cardiovascular diseases, and reduced adiponectin secretion. Vitamin A derivatives/retinoids are involved in several of these processes, which mainly take place in white adipose tissue (WAT). In this study, we examined adiponectin expression as a function of high-fat and high-vitamin A dietary conditions in mice. Decreased adiponectin expression in addition to upregulation of aldehyde dehydrogenase A1 (ALDH1A1), retinoid signaling, and retinoic acid response element signaling were observed significantly. selective in the WAT of mice fed a normal vitamin A and high-fat diet. Reduced expression of adiponectin in WAT was also observed in mice fed a vitamin A-rich diet. Adipose cell culture revealed that selective endogenous and synthetic retinoic acid receptor (RAR) agonists a and RARg, together with a synthetic retinoid X receptor agonist, effectively reduced adiponectin expression, whereas ALDH1A1 expression increased only with RAR agonists. We conclude that reduced adiponectin expression under high-fat dietary conditions depends on 1) increased ALDH1A1 expression in adipocytes, which does not increase all-trans-retinoic acid levels; 2) increased WAT-selective RAR ligand-induced signaling mediated by retinoic acid response elements; and 3) reduction of RAR ligand-dependent adiponectin expression.-Landrier, J.-F., Kasiri, E., Karkeni, E., Mihaly, J., Beke, G., Weiss, K. , Lucas, R., Aydemir, G., Salles, J., Walrand, S., de Lera, AR, Ruhl, R. Reduced expression of adiponectin after a high-fat diet is associated with selective upregulation of ALDH1A1 and additional retinoic acid receptor signaling in adipose tissues. fabric.\n",
      "Type II phosphatidylinositol 4-kinase (PI4KII) enzymes synthesize the lipid phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate (PI(4)P), which has been detected at the Golgi complex and endosomal compartments and recruits clathrin adapters. Despite common mechanistic similarities between the isoforms, the extent of their redundancy is unclear. We found that depletion of PI4KIIa and PI4KIIb using small interfering RNA led to actin remodeling. Depletion of PI4KIIb also induced the formation of invadopodia containing membrane type I matrix metalloproteinase (MT1-MMP). Depletion of PI4KII isoforms also differentially affected the PI(4)P and post-TGN trafficking pools of the trans-Golgi network (TGN). Depletion of PI4KIIb led to increased trafficking of MT1-MMP to invasive structures at the plasma membrane and was accompanied by reduced colocalization of MT1-MMP with membranes containing the endosomal markers Rab5 and Rab7, but of increased localization with exocytic Rab8. Depletion of PI4KIIb was sufficient to confer an aggressive invasive phenotype to the minimally invasive HeLa and MCF-7 cell lines. Mining of oncogenomic databases revealed that loss of the PI4K2B allele and underexpression of PI4KIIb mRNA are associated with human cancers. This finding supports the cellular data and suggests that PI4KIIb could be a clinically significant invasion suppressor. We propose that PI4KIIb synthesizes a pool of PI(4)P that maintains MT1-MMP trafficking in the degradation pathway and suppresses invadopodia formation.\n",
      "Inactivating mutations in the phosphate regulator gene with homologies to endopeptidase on the X chromosome (PHEX) have been identified as a cause of X-linked hypophosphatemic rickets (XLH; OMIM 307800). In the present study, we recruited 43 patients from 18 unrelated families clinically diagnosed with hypophosphatemic rickets and 250 healthy controls. For each available individual, the 22 exons with their exon-intron boundaries of the PHEX gene were directly sequenced. Serum fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF23) levels were also measured. Sequencing analysis detected 17 different mutations in the PHEX gene, and 7 of them were identified as novel: 3 missense mutations, including c.304G>A (p.Gly102Arg) in exon 3, c .229T>C (p.Cys77Arg) in exon 3. and c.824T>C (p.Leu275Pro) in exon 7; 2 deletion mutations, including c.528delT (p.Glu177LysfsX44) in exon 5 and c.1234delA (p.Ser412ValfsX12) in exon 11; and 2 alternative splicing mutations, including c.436_436+1delAG in intron 4 at splice donor sites and c.1483-1G>C in intron 13 at splice acceptor sites. Additionally, 6 mutations were found de novo in 6 sporadic cases and the probands were all female. No mutations were found in the 250 healthy controls. Serum FGF23 levels varied significantly among XLH patients and no significant differences were found compared with those in healthy controls. Overall, the results of this study provide new insights into the spectrum of PHEX mutations and provide potential evidence for a critical domain in the PHEX protein. Furthermore, the finding of overlap in serum FGF23 levels between XLH patients and healthy controls indicates its limited diagnostic value in XLH.\n",
      "To probe the role of protein arginine methyltransferase 5 (PRMT5) in regulating inflammation, cell proliferation, migration and invasion of fibroblast-like synoviocytes (FLS) from patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) . FLS were separated from synovial tissues (ST) of patients with RA and osteoarthritis (OA). A PRMT5 inhibitor (EPZ015666) and short interference RNA (siRNA) against PRMT5 were used to inhibit PRMT5 expression. The protein standard was measured by Western blotting or immunofluorescence. Excretion and gene expression of inflammatory factors were estimated by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR), respectively. In vitro migration and invasion were detected by the Boyden chamber assay. FLS proliferation was detected by BrdU incorporation. An increase in PRMT5 was found in ST and FLS of RA patients. In RA FLS, the level of PRMT5 was upregulated by stimulation with IL-1b and TNF-a. Inhibition of PRMT5 by EPZ015666 and siRNA-mediated knockdown reduced IL-6 and IL-8 production as well as RA FLS proliferation. Furthermore, PRMT5 inhibition decreased in vitro migration and invasion of FLS RA. Furthermore, EPZ015666 restricted the phosphorylation of IkB kinaseb and IkBa, as well as the nuclear translocation of p65 as well as AKT in FLS. PRMT5 regulated the production of inflammatory factors, cell proliferation, migration and invasion of RA FLS, mediated by NF-kB and AKT pathways. Our data suggest that targeting PRMT5 to prevent synovial inflammation and destruction could be a promising treatment for RA.\n",
      "Otilonium bromide (OB) is a spasmolytic drug used successfully for the treatment of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). Its effectiveness has been attributed to blocking L- and T-type Ca(2+) channels and muscarinic and tachykinin receptors in smooth muscle. Furthermore, in healthy rats, repeated administration of OB altered neurotransmitter expression and function, suggesting alternative mechanisms of action. On this basis, we investigated whether repeated OB treatment prevented the functional and neurochemical changes observed in the colon of rats subjected to restraint stress (WRS), a psychosocial stressor considered suitable for reproducing the main signs and symptoms of IBS. . In the control group, functional parameters of WRS and OB/WRS rats were measured in vivo and morphological investigations were carried out ex vivo in the colon. The results showed that OB counteracts most of the neurotransmitter changes caused by WRS. In particular, the drug prevents the decrease in SP-, NK1r-, nNOS-, VIP- and S100b immunoreactivity (IR) and the increase in CGRP- and CRF1r-IR. In contrast, OB does not affect the increase in CRF2r-IR neurons observed in WRS rats and does not interfere with the mild mucosal inflammation caused by WRS. Finally, OB itself increases Mr2 expression in the muscle wall and decreases the number of ChAT-IR myenteric neurons. Functional results show a significant reduction in the number of spontaneous abdominal contractions in OB-treated rats. The ability of OB to block L-type Ca(2+) channels, also expressed by enteric neurons, could represent a possible mechanism by which OB exerts its actions.\n",
      "Primary cilia are specialized sensory and developmental signaling devices extending from the surface of most eukaryotic cells. Defects in these organelles cause inherited human disorders (ciliopathies) such as retinitis pigmentosa and Bardet-Biedl syndrome (BBS), frequently affecting many physiological and developmental processes in multiple organs. Cilium formation, maintenance, and function depend on intracellular transport systems such as intraflagellar transport (IFT), which is driven by the kinesin-2 and IFT-dynein motors and regulated by the syndrome's cargo-adaptor protein complex. of Bardet-Biedl (BBS), or BBSome. . To identify novel cilium-associated genes, we used the nematode C. elegans, where ciliogenesis occurs within a short time frame during late embryogenesis, when most sensory neurons differentiate. Using whole-organism RNA-Seq libraries, we discovered a highly enriched signature expression profile for transcripts of known ciliary proteins, including FAM-161 (FAM161A ortholog), CCDC-104 (CCDC104), and RPI-1 (RP1/RP1L1), which we confirm is localized in worm cilia. From a list of 185 candidate ciliary genes, we discover orthologs of human MAP9, YAP, CCDC149, and RAB28 as conserved cilium-associated components. Further analyzes of C. elegans RAB-28, recently associated with autosomal recessive cone-rod dystrophy, reveal that this small GTPase is exclusively expressed in ciliated neurons where it dynamically associates with IFT trains. While inactive GDP-bound RAB-28 exhibits no IFT movement or diffuse localization, GTP-bound (activated) RAB-28 concentrates at the periciliary membrane in a BBSome-dependent manner and undergoes bidirectional IFT. Functional analyzes reveal that although cilium structure, sensory function, and IFT are apparently normal in a rab-28 null allele, overexpression of the predicted GDP-locked or GTP-locked variants of RAB-28 disrupts cilium morphogenesis and function. eyelash and sensory pores. Collectively, our results present a novel approach to identifying ciliary proteins and unveil RAB28, a GTPase most closely related to the BBS protein RABL4/IFT27, as an IFT-associated cargo with dependent cell-autonomous and non-autonomous functions. of the BBSome at the ciliary level. base.\n",
      "Desminopathies caused by mutation of the gene coding for desmin are genetically protein aggregation myopathies. Mitochondrial dysfunction is one of the pathological changes of early-stage desminopathies. The molecular mechanisms of mitochondrial dysfunction in desminopathies remain exclusive. VDAC1 regulates mitochondrial uptake across the outer membrane and mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilization (MOMP). The relationships between desminopathies and voltage-gated anion channel 1 (VDAC1) remain unclear. Here, we successfully constructed the desminopathy rat model, evaluated with conventional stains, containing hematoxylin and eosin (HE), Gomori trichrome (MGT), (PAS), oil red ( ORO), NADH-TR, SDH staining and immunohistochemistry. Immunofluorescence results showed that VDAC1 was accumulated in the highly desmin-stained area of ​​muscle fibers from desminopathy patients or desminopathy rat model compared to normal models. Meanwhile, apoptosis-related proteins bax and ATF2 were involved in deminopathy patients and the desminopathy rat model, but not bcl-2, bcl-xl, or HK2. VDAC1 and desmin are closely relevant in tissue splicing of deminopathy patients and desminopathy rats at the protein lever. Additionally, apoptotic proteins are also involved in desminopathies, such as bax, ATF2, but not bcl-2, bcl-xl or HK2. This pathological analysis presents the correlation between VDAC1 and desmin, and apoptosis-related proteins are correlated in desminopathy. Furthermore, we propose a rat desminopathy model for the study of desmin-related myopathy.\n",
      "Oxidative stress plays an essential role in inflammation and fibrosis. Bach1 is an important transcriptional repressor that acts by modulating oxidative stress and represents a potential target in the treatment of pulmonary fibrosis (PF). In this study, we knocked down Bach1 using adenovirus-mediated small interfering RNA (siRNA) to determine whether the use of Bach1 siRNA is an effective therapeutic strategy in mice with bleomycin-induced PF. (BLM). Mouse lung fibroblasts (MLF) were incubated with transforming growth factor (TGF)-b1 (5 ng/ml) and then infected with recombinant adenovirus-like Bach1 siRNA1 and Bach1 siRNA2, while an adenovirus vector Blank was used as a negative control. The selected Bach1 siRNA with higher interference efficiency was used for animal experiments. A mouse model of BLM-induced PF was established and Bach1 siRNA (1 x 109 pfu) was administered to mice via the tail vein. The results revealed that Bach1 mRNA and protein levels were significantly downregulated by Bach1 siRNA. Additionally, MLFs infected with Bach1 siRNA showed increased mRNA and protein expression levels of heme oxygenase-1 and glutathione peroxidase 1, but decreased levels of TGF-b1 and d interleukin-6 in cell supernatants compared to cells exposed to TGF-b1 alone. . Bach1 knockdown by siRNA also enhanced the expression of antioxidant factors, but suppressed that of fibrosis-related cytokines in mice compared to the BLM group. Finally, the inflammatory infiltration of alveolar and interstitial cells and destruction of lung structure were significantly attenuated in mide-administered Bach1 siRNA compared with those in the BLM group. Overall, our results demonstrate that Bach1 siRNA exerts protective effects against BLM-induced PF in mice. Our data could serve as a basis for the development of new targeted therapeutic strategies for PF.\n",
      "Alcohol consumption is a risk factor for breast cancer. Little is known about the mechanism, although acetaldehyde- or estrogen-mediated pathways are hypothesized to play a role. We previously showed that long-term exposure to 2.5 mM ethanol (blood alcohol ~0.012%) of MCF-12A, a normal breast epithelial cell line, induced epithelial mesenchymal transition (EMT). ) and oncogenic transformation. In this study, we investigated, in the human breast cancer cell line MCF-7, whether similar exposure to ethanol at concentrations up to peak blood levels in heavy drinkers would increase malignant progression. Short-term incubation (1 week) in ethanol at a concentration as low as 1 to 5 mM (corresponding to a blood alcohol concentration of approximately 0.0048 to 0.024%) upregulated proteins bound to Oct4 and Nanog stem cells, but they were reduced after exposure at 25 hours. mM. Long-term exposure (4 weeks) to 25 mM ethanol upregulated Oct4 and Nanog proteins, as well as the malignancy marker Ceacam6. Microarray analysis in cells exposed for 1 week showed upregulated expression of metallothionein genes, particularly MT1X. Long-term exposure upregulated the expression of some malignancy-related genes (STEAP4, SERPINA3, SAMD9, GDF15, KRT15, ​​ITGB6, TP63, and PGR, as well as the CEACAM gene families, related to interferon and HLA). Some of these results were validated by RT-PCR. Similar treatment also modulated numerous microRNAs (miRs), including a regulator of Oct4, as well as miRs involved in oncogenesis and/or malignancy, with only a few estrogen-induced miRs. Long-term 25 mM ethanol also induced a 5.6-fold upregulation of anchorage-independent growth, an indicator of malignant-like characteristics. Exposure to acetaldehyde resulted in little or no effect comparable to that of ethanol. The previously demonstrated alcoholic induction of oncogenic transformation of normal breast cells is now complemented by the current results suggesting the potential involvement of alcohol in the malignant progression of breast cancer.\n",
      "Meiotic resumption (G2/M transition) and progression to meiosis I (MI) are two key steps for the production of fertilization-competent eggs. Here we report that CenpH, a component of the inner kinetochore plate, is responsible for the G2/M transition in mouse meiotic oocytes. Depletion of CenpH by morpholino injection decreased cyclin B1 levels, leading to attenuation of maturation-promoting factor (MPF) activation and severely compromised meiotic resumption. CenpH protects cyclin B1 from destruction by competing with the action of APC/C(Cdh1). An impaired G2/M transition after CenpH depletion could be rescued by expression of exogenous cyclin B1. Unexpectedly, blocking CenpH did not affect spindle organization or meiotic cell cycle progression after germinal vesicle rupture. Our results reveal a novel role for CenpH in regulating the G2/M meiotic transition by acting via the APC/C(Cdh1)-cyclin B1 pathway.\n",
      "The pathogenesis of human type 1 diabetes, characterized by immune-mediated damage to insulin-producing B cells of the pancreatic islets, may involve viral infection. Essential components of the innate antiviral immune response, including type I interferon (IFN) and IFN receptor-mediated signaling pathways, are candidates for determining susceptibility to type 1 diabetes in humans. Many aspects of the pathogenesis of human type 1 diabetes are recapitulated in the LEW.1WR1 rat model. Diabetes can be induced in LEW.1WR1 weaned rats exposed to the virus or the viral mimetic polyinosinic:polycytidylic acid (poly I:C). We hypothesized that disruption of the cognate type I IFN receptor (type I IFN a/b receptor [IFNAR]) to interrupt IFN signaling would prevent or delay the development of diabetes mellitus. viral. We generated IFNAR1 subunit-deficient LEW.1WR1 rats using CRISPR-Cas9 (clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats-associated protein 9) genome editing and confirmed functional disruption of the Ifnar1 gene. IFNAR1 deficiency significantly delayed the onset and frequency of diabetes and significantly reduced the intensity of insulitis after poly I:C treatment. The occurrence of Kilham rat virus-induced diabetes was also decreased in IFNAR1-deficient animals. These results clearly establish that alterations in innate immunity influence the progression of autoimmune diabetes and support the use of targeted strategies to limit or prevent the development of type 1 diabetes.\n",
      "BACKGROUND:PIK3CA mutations are expected to be potential therapeutic targets for esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC). We aimed to clarify the concordance between PIK3CA mutations detected in endoscopic biopsy samples and corresponding surgically resected samples. METHODS: We examined five hotspot mutations in the PIK3CA gene (E542K, E545K, E546K, H1047R, and H1047L) in formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue sections of paired endoscopic biopsies and surgically resected specimens from 181 patients undergoing curative resection for ESCC between 2000 and 2011 using a multiplex genetic mutation detection kit based on Luminex technology. RESULTS: Mutation analyzes were successfully performed for endoscopic biopsies and surgically resected specimens in all cases. A PIK3CA mutation was detected in either sample type in 13 cases (7.2%, 95% confidence interval: 3.9-12.0). The overall agreement rate, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value were 98.3% (178/181), 90.9% (10/11), and 98.8% (168/170), respectively. Among patients with PIK3CA mutation detected in both sample types, concordance between PIK3CA mutation genotypes was 100%. There were three cases with discordant mutation status between sample types (PIK3CA mutation in a surgically resected sample and wild type in a biopsy sample in two cases, and opposite pattern in one case), suggesting possible heterogeneity. intratumoral PIK3CA mutation status. . CONCLUSIONS: PIK3CA mutation status was highly concordant between endoscopic biopsy and surgically resected samples from the same patient, suggesting that endoscopic biopsy samples can be used clinically to detect PIK3CA mutations in patients with ESCC.\n",
      "Th17 cells and the cytokine they produce, interleukin (IL)-17, play an important role in tumor progression in humans and mice. IL-6 and IL-23 are cytokines essential for the differentiation and spread of Th17 cells, respectively. Bacterial lipopolysaccharides (LPS) are known to stimulate immune cells to produce such inflammatory cytokines. Unlike Escherichia coli (E. coli) LPS, spirulina LPS has low toxicity and barely induces in vivo production of IL-6 and IL-23 in mice. We examined the antitumor effects of spirulina LPS compared to E. coli LPS. coli in an MH134 hepatoma model. Spirulina LPS administration suppressed tumor growth in C3H/HeN mice, but not in Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) mutant C3H/HeJ mice, by reducing serum levels of IL-17 and 'IL-23, while increasing interferon (IFN)-g levels. Antitumor activity and IFN-g production were mediated by T lymphocytes. Additionally, in vitro experiments showed that spirulina LPS impairs the antigen-presenting function that supports the generation of producer cells of IL-17 in a Toll-like receptor (TLR)4-dependent manner. Of note, injection of anti-IL-17 antibodies into tumor-bearing C3H/HeN mice in the absence of spirulina LPS markedly suppressed tumor growth and increased responses to IFN-g. Thus, our results support the idea that IFN-g and IL-17/IL-23 mutually regulate Th17 and Th1 responses in tumor-bearing hosts, and that LPS from spirulina modulates the balance of IFN-g-IL-17/IL-23. axis towards the production of IFN-g, which leads to tumor inhibition. In addition, Spirulina LPS effectively inhibits the spontaneous development of breast tumors. This study has important implications for the exploitation of TLR-based immunomodulators for cancer immunotherapy.\n",
      "Never in mitosis, gene A (NIMA)-related kinase 2 (NEK2) is a microtubule-associated protein that regulates spindle assembly in human cells and is overexpressed in various malignancies. However, the role of NEK2 in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) remains undetermined. We performed RNA sequencing of the HCC cell line SMMC-7721 and the normal liver cell line HL-7702 using the Ion Proton system. NEK2 expression was detected using quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction in two cell lines and 5 matched HCC and adjacent non-tumor liver tissues. The correlation between survival and NEK2 expression was analyzed in 359 HCC patients using RNASeqV2 data available at The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) website (http://tcga-data.nci.nih. gov/tcga/). The expression of NEK2, phospho-AKT, and MMP-2 was assessed by immunohistochemistry in 63 HCC cases and corresponded to adjacent non-tumor liver tissues. Relationships between protein expression and clinicopathological parameters were evaluated, as well as correlations between NEK2 and phospho-AKT and MMP-2 expressions. A total of 610 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were revealed during transcriptome comparison, of which 297 were upregulated and 313 were downregulated in HCC. NEK2, as the most obviously different DEG in cells and tissues of RNA sequencing data, was listed as a candidate HCC biomarker for further verification. NEK2 was overexpressed in HCC cells and tissues (P=0.002, P=0.013), and HCC patients with high NEK2 expression had a poor prognosis (P=0.0145). Clinical analysis indicated that NEK2 overexpression in HCC was significantly correlated with complete diolamina (P < 0.001), number of tumor nodules (P = 0.012), and recurrence (P = 0.004). NEK2 expression was positively correlated with phospho-AKT (r = 0.883, P < 0.01) and MMP-2 (r = 0.781, P < 0.01) expression. NEK2 overexpression was associated with clinicopathological features and poor patient outcomes, suggesting that NEK2 serves as a prognostic biomarker for HCC. Alteration of NEK2 protein levels may contribute to HCC invasion and metastasis, which may occur through activation of AKT signaling and promotion of MMP-2 expression.\n",
      "BACKGROUND: ADAM12 is upregulated in human breast cancers and is a predictor of chemoresistance in estrogen receptor-negative tumors. ADAM12 is induced during epithelial-mesenchymal transition, a feature associated with claudin-low breast tumors enriched in cancer stem cell (CSC) markers. It is currently unknown whether ADAM12 plays an active role in promoting the CSC phenotype in breast cancer cells. METHODS: ADAM12 expression was downregulated in representative claudin-low breast cancer cell lines, SUM159PT and Hs578T, using siRNA transfection or inducible shRNA expression. Cellular characteristics commonly associated with the CSC phenotype in vitro (cell migration, invasion, anoikis resistance, mammosphere formation, ALDH activity and expression of cell surface markers CD44 and CD24) and in vivo (tumor formation in mice at using limiting dilution transplantation assays) were evaluated. RNA sequencing was performed to identify global changes in gene expression after ADAM12 knockdown. RESULTS: We found that sorted SUM159PT cell populations with high levels of ADAM12 had elevated expression of CSC markers and an increased ability to form mammospheres. Knockdown of ADAM12 reduced cell migration and invasion, decreased anoikis resistance, and compromised mammosphere formation. Knockdown of ADAM12 also decreased ALDEFLUOR(+) and CD44(hi)/CD24(-/lo)-enriched populations in CSCs in vitro and reduced tumorigenesis in mice in vivo. RNA sequencing identified significant overlap between genes regulated by ADAM12 and epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR). Therefore, ADAM12 knockdown lowered the basal activation level of EGFR and this effect was abolished by the metalloproteinase inhibitor batimastat. Furthermore, incubation of cells with exogenously added EGF prevented the downregulation of the CD44(hi)/CD24(-/lo) cell population by ADAM12 inactivation. CONCLUSIONS: These results indicate that ADAM12 actively supports the CSC phenotype in claudin-low breast cancer cells via modulation of the EGFR pathway.\n",
      "Star-PAP is a non-canonical poly(A) polymerase and is required for the expression of a selected set of mRNAs. However, the pathological role of Star-PAP in cancer remains largely unknown. In this study, we observed a decrease in Star-PAP expression in breast cancer cell lines and tissues. Ectopic expression of Star-PAP inhibited the proliferation as well as the colony-forming capacity of breast cancer cells. In breast cancer patients, high Star-PAP levels were correlated with improved prognosis. Furthermore, by regulating the expression of BIK (BCL2-interacting killer), Star-PAP induced apoptosis of breast cancer cells through the mitochondrial pathway. Growth of breast cancer xenografts in NOD/SCID mice was also inhibited by doxycycline-induced overexpression of Star-PAP. Additionally, Star-PAP sensitized breast cancer cells to chemotherapy drugs in vitro and in vivo. In mammary epithelial cells, Star-PAP knockdown partially transformed these cells and induced them to undergo epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). These results suggest that Star-PAP possesses tumor suppressive activity and may be a valuable target for the development of novel therapeutic strategies against cancer.\n",
      "Transforming growth factor (TGF)-b-inducible early gene-1 (TIEG1) plays a crucial role in modulating apoptosis and cell proliferation in a number of diseases, including pancreatic cancer, leukemia and osteoporosis. However, the functional role of TIEG1 in the heart has not been fully defined. In this study, we first investigated the role of TIEG1 in ischemic heart disease. For in vitro experiments, cardiomyocytes were isolated from TIEG1 knockout (KO) and Wile-like (WT) mice, and apoptosis rates were assessed after a 48-hour ischemic insult. A cell proliferation test was carried out after 7 days of incubation under normoxic conditions. Additionally, the angiogenic capacity of endothelial cells was determined by tube formation assay. For in vivo experiments, a myocardial infarction (MI) model was established using both TIEG1 KO and WT mice. Echocardiography was performed 3 and 28 days after MI, while hemodynamic testing was performed 28 days after MI. Histological analyzes of apoptosis, proliferation, angiogenesis, and infarct area assessments were performed using terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase-mediated TUNEL (dUTP nick-end labeling) staining, BrdU immunostaining, smooth muscle actin (a-SMA)/CD31 and Masson's trichrome immunostaining, respectively. Changes in the expression of related proteins caused by TIEG1 deficiency were confirmed using reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) and Western blot analysis. Our results demonstrated that the absence of TIEG1 prevented cardiomyocytes from undergoing apoptosis and promoted higher proliferation; it stimulated endothelial cell proliferation in vitro and in vivo. Improved cardiac function and less scar formation were observed in TIEG1 KO mice, and we also observed altered expression of phosphatase and tensin homolog (Pten), Akt, and Bcl- 2/Bax, as well as vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). Overall, our results indicate that the absence of TIEG1 plays a cardioprotective role in ischemic heart disease by promoting changes in Pten/Akt signaling.\n",
      "Epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) is a critical step in the acquisition of metastatic and invasive power of tumor cells. Colorectal adenocarcinoma (CRC) is a common cancer where metastasis is directly linked to patient survival. Recent studies show that pleomorphic adenoma type 2 (PLAGL2) gene could induce tumor EMT and is an independent predictive factor associated with poor cancer prognosis. In the present study, we confirmed the role of PLAGL2 in the prognosis of CRC patients and provided molecular evidence of PLAGL2-promoted EMT in CRC cell line SW480. We found that PLAGL2 expression was upregulated in paraffin-embedded CRC tissues compared to borderline or benign tissues. Experimental EMT induced by transfection of PLAGL2 plasmid proved that overexpression of PLAGL2 protein could improve wound healing and transwell ability of cells and significantly upregulation of mesenchymal marker proteins, N-cadherin and vimentin, and simultaneously downregulation of the epithelial marker E-cadherin. Subsequently, through Western blot assay, we found that PLAGL2 could activate the wnt signaling component, b-catenin, in nuclei. More CRC cell metastases to the lungs were observed when PLAGL2-overexpressing SW480 cells were injected into the tail vein of rats, compared with the cell control group and the PLAGL2-silenced group. Our results indicated that PLAGL2 could be a key very upstream molecule regulating EMT involved in the Wnt/b-catenin signaling pathway.\n",
      "Hypoxia is widely accepted as a fundamental biological phenomenon, strongly associated with tissue damage and cell viability under stressful conditions. Insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) is known to protect tissues from several types of damage and protect cells from apoptosis. Hypoxia is a regulatory factor of the IGF system, but the role of the IGF-1 receptor (IGF-1R) in hypoxia-induced apoptosis remains unclear. The present study investigated potential mechanisms associated with IGF-1R-associated apoptosis under hypoxic conditions. Mouse embryonic fibroblasts with IGF-1R disruption or overexpression (R cells and R+ cells) were used to examine the level of apoptosis, autophagy, and reactive oxygen species production ( ROS). The autophagy inhibitor 3-methyladenine was used to evaluate the effect of autophagy on ROS production and apoptosis under hypoxic conditions. A potential downstream signaling pathway involving phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/threonine protein kinase B (Akt)/mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) was identified by Western blot analysis. The results demonstrated that hypoxia induced apoptosis, increased ROS production, and promoted autophagy in a time-dependent manner compared to that observed under normoxia. R+ cells had a lower percentage of apoptotic cells, lower ROS production, and higher autophagy levels than R- cells. Additionally, autophagy inhibition resulted in increased ROS production and a higher percentage of apoptotic cells in both cell types. Additionally, IGF-1R is linked to the PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling pathway and enhanced expression of autophagy-associated proteins, which was verified after treatment with the PI3K inhibitor LY294002. These results indicated that IGF-1R can increase cell viability under hypoxic conditions by promoting autophagy and the production of scavenger ROS, which are gated by the PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling pathway.\n",
      "Contrast-induced nephropathy (CIN) is an acute iatrogenic renal failure occurring following intravascular injection of an iodinated radiographic contrast agent. However, the regulatory mechanisms of CIN remain to be elucidated. The present study aimed to determine whether atorvastatin protects against CIN via anti-apoptotic effects through upregulation of Hsp27 in vivo and in vitro. To determine whether atorvastatin attenuated CIN, inflammatory response, and apoptosis in vivo and in vitro, a rat model of iopamidol-induced CIN was used and cell damage of the human embryonic proximal tubule (HK2) was observed. been evaluated. Rats were divided into four groups (n = 10 per group), as follows: control rats; rats + atorvastatin; rats + iopamidol; rats+iopamidol+atorvastatin. In vitro, HK2 cells were treated with iopamidol in the presence or absence of atorvastatin, heat shock protein (Hsp) 27, small interfering (si)RNA, or pcDNA3.1-Hsp27. Kidney tissues were examined histopathologically and collected for Western blot analysis. The results showed that atorvastatin improved apoptosis and deterioration of renal function (P < 0.05). Furthermore, atorvastatin reduced iopamidol-induced activity of B-cell lymphoma-associated protein X (Bax)/caspase-3-2 (Bcl-2) and increased Bcl-2 expression. in vivo and in vitro. Notably, after treatment with Hsp27 siRNA or pcDNA3.1-Hsp27, iopamidol was found to enhance or weaken the upregulation of Bax/caspase-3 and downregulation of Bcl-2 in HK2 cells, respectively. . The results of the present study suggest that atorvastatin protects against contrast-induced renal tubular cell apoptosis through upregulation of Hsp27 in vivo and in vitro.\n",
      "Fatty acid synthase (FASN) is a key anabolic enzyme for de novo fatty acid synthesis, which is important in the development of colon carcinoma. The high expression of FASN is considered a promising molecular target for the treatment of colon cancer. Emodin, a natural anthraquinone, exhibits anticancer effect on various types of human cancer, including colon cancer; however, the molecular mechanisms remain to be elucidated. Cell viability was assessed using a Cell Counting Kit-8 assay. The apoptosis rate of cells was quantified by flow cytometry after annexin V/propidium iodide staining. FASN activity was measured by monitoring the oxidation of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate at a wavelength of 340 nm, and intracellular free fatty acid levels were detected using a quantification kit. free fatty acids. Western blot analysis and reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction were used to detect the expression of target genes and proteins. The present study was carried out to determine whether FASN gene expression and its enzymatic activity are regulated by emodin in a human colon cancer cell line. Emodin markedly inhibited the proliferation of HCT116 cells, and a higher FASN protein level was expressed compared to that in SW480, SNU-C2A, or SNU-C5 cells. Emodin significantly decreased the protein expression of FASN in HCT116 cells, caused by protein degradation due to high protein ubiquitination. Emodin also inhibited intracellular FASN enzymatic activity and reduced intracellular free fatty acid levels. Emodin enhanced antiproliferation and apoptosis in a dose- and time-dependent manner. Combined treatment of emodin and cerulenin, a commercial FASN inhibitor, had an additive effect on these activities. Palmitate, the end product of the FASN reaction, rescued emodin-induced viability and apoptosis. Furthermore, emodin altered signaling pathways involved in FASN, including phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/Akt and mitogen-activated protein kinases/extracellular signal-regulated kinases 1/2. These results suggest that emodin-regulated cell growth and apoptosis are mediated by FASN inhibition and provide a molecular basis for the treatment of colon cancer.\n",
      "Liver kinase B1 (LKB1) is a serine/threonine protein kinase expressed ubiquitously in mammalian cells. It was first identified in Puisz-Jeghers syndrome as a tumor suppressor gene. It is unknown whether endothelial LKB1 regulates angiogenesis and tumor growth. In this study, we generated endothelial cell-specific LKB1-knockout (LKB1(endo-/-)) mice by crossing vascular endothelial-cadherin-Cre mice with LKB1(flox/flox) mice. Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) level was strongly co-stained in endothelial cells but not in macrophages in LKB1(endo-/-) mice. Consistently, tissues from LKB1 (endo-/-) mice, including lung, skin, kidney, and liver, exhibited increased vascular permeability. Tumors implanted in LKB1 (endo-/-) mice, but not in macrophage-specific LKB1 knockout mice, grew faster and showed enhanced vascular permeability and increased angiogenesis compared to those implanted in wild-type mice. Injection of VEGF-neutralizing antibody, but not isotype-matched control antibody, decreased endothelial cell angiogenesis and tumor growth in vivo. Furthermore, knockdown of LKB1 enhanced mouse retinal and cellular angiogenesis, and knockdown of VEGF by small interfering RNA decreased endothelial cell proliferation and migration. Re-expression of LKB1 or knockdown of VEGF receptor 2 decreased the overproliferation and migration observed in LKB1 (endo-/-) cells. Mechanistically, LKB1 could bind to the VEGF transcription factor specificity protein 1 (Sp1), which would then inhibit the binding of Sp1 to the VEGF promoter to reduce VEGF expression. Endothelial LKB1 can regulate endothelial angiogenesis and tumor growth by modulating Sp1-mediated VEGF expression.\n",
      "Deregulation of the oncogenic transcription factor MYC induces B cell transformation and is a driver of B cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma (B-NHL). MYC overexpression in B-NHL is associated with more aggressive phenotypes and poor prognosis. Although genomic studies suggest a link between MYC overexpression and B-cell receptor (BCR) signaling molecules in B-NHL, the signaling pathways essential for Myc-mediated B-cell transformation have not been identified. been fully elucidated. We used intracellular phospho flow cytometry to study the relationship between Myc and BCR signaling in pre-malignant B cells. Using the Eu-myc mouse model, where Myc is overexpressed specifically in B cells, basal and stimulated BCR signaling was increased in precancerous B cells from Eu-myc mice compared to wild-type littermates. Myc-overexpressing B cells had constitutively higher levels of activated CD79a, Btk, Plcg2, and Erk1/2. Notably, Myc-overexpressing B cells maintained elevated BCR signaling despite treatment with ibrutinib, a Bruton tyrosine kinase inhibitor. Additionally, PI3K/Akt pathway signaling was also increased in Eu-myc B cells, and this increase was partially suppressed with ibrutinib. Furthermore, experiments with Btk-null B cells revealed off-target effects of ibrutinib on BCR signaling. Our data show that in pre-malignant B cells, Myc overexpression is sufficient to activate the BCR and PI3K/Akt signaling pathways and further enhances signaling after BCR ligation. Therefore, our results indicate that precancerous B cells have already acquired enhanced survival and growth capabilities before transformation, and that high levels of MYC confer resistance to pharmacological inhibitors of BCR signaling, which has significant implications. for the treatment of B-NHL.\n",
      "Leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) is essential to make the uterus receptive to blastocyst implantation. In mice, LIF receptor (LIFR) expression is largely restricted to the uterine luminal epithelium (LE). LIF, secreted by endometrial glands (EG), binds to LIFR, activating the Janus kinase signal transducer and activation of the signaling transcription (STAT) 3 (Jak-Stat3) pathway in the LE. Activation of JAK-STAT converts the LE into a receptive state so that juxtaposed blastocysts begin to implant. To specifically suppress LIFR in LE, we derived a mouse line in which Cre recombinase was inserted into the endogenous lactoferrin gene (Ltf-Cre). Lactoferrin expression in the LE is induced by E2 and we demonstrate that Cre recombinase activity is restricted to the LE and GE. To determine the requirements for LIFR during implantation, we derived an additional mouse line carrying a conditional (floxed) Lifr flx/flx gene. Crossing Ltf-Cre mice with Lifr flx/flx mice generated Lifr flx/D:Ltf Cre/+ females that were obviously normal but sterile. Many of these females, despite repeated mating, did not become pregnant. Non-implantation blastocysts were recovered from the Lifr flx/D:Ltf Cre/+ uterus and, when transferred to wild-type recipients, implanted normally, indicating that uterine receptivity rather than embryo competence is compromised . Loss of Lifr results in both failure of STAT3 translocation to LE nuclei and reduced expression of the LIF-regulated gene Msx1 that regulates uterine receptivity. These results reveal that uterine expression of LIFR is essential for embryo implantation and further define the components of the LIF signaling pathway necessary for efficient implantation.\n",
      "Psoriasin (S100A7) is a small 11 kDa calcium-binding protein initially isolated from psoriatic skin lesions. It belongs to the S100 family of proteins that play important roles in various cellular functions, including proliferation, differentiation, migration and apoptosis. Aberrant psoriasin expression has been implicated in a range of cancers and is often associated with poor prognosis. This study examined the role of psoriasin on pancreatic cancer cell functions and its involvement in disease progression. Psoriasin expression was determined in a pancreatic tissue cohort including 126 pancreatic tumors and 114 adjacent non-tumor pancreatic tissues. Inactivation and overexpression of psoriasin in pancreatic cancer cells was carried out using specifically constructed plasmids, which contained either an anti-psoriasin ribozyme transgene or the complete coding sequence of human psoriasin. Psoriasin inactivation and overexpression were verified by conventional RT-PCR and qPCR. The effect of manipulating psoriasin expression on pancreatic cancer cell functions was evaluated using several in vitro cell function assays. Locally invasive pancreatic cancers extending beyond the pancreas expressed higher levels of psoriasin transcripts compared to cancers confined to the pancreas. Primary tumors with distant metastases showed reduced psoriasin expression. Psoriasin overexpression cell lines showed significantly increased growth and migration compared to control cells. Furthermore, overexpression of psoriasin led to increased invasion of pancreatic cancer cells, associated with upregulation of matrix metalloproteinase-2 (MMP-2) and MMP-9. Psoriasin overexpression also promoted the aggregation and survival of pancreatic cancer cells when they lost their anchorage. Overall, higher psoriasin expression was associated with local invasion in pancreatic cancers. Psoriasin expression is associated with growth, migration, cell-matrix adhesion and invasion of pancreatic cancer cells via regulation of MMPs. As such, the proposed implications of psoriasin in invasion, disease progression, and as a potential therapeutic target warrant further investigation.\n",
      "Dystonia is a neurological movement disorder that causes the body to perform twisting movements, repetitive movements, or abnormal postures that are sometimes painful. With the advent of next-generation sequencing technologies, homozygous T71N and A190T mutations in the neuronal calcium sensor (NCS) hippocalcin have been identified as the genetic cause of isolated primary dystonia (DYT2 dystonia). However, the effect of these mutations on the physiological role of hippocalcin has not yet been elucidated. Using a multidisciplinary approach, we demonstrated that hippocalcin oligomerizes in a calcium-dependent manner and binds to voltage-gated calcium channels. Hippocalcin T71N and A190T mutations did not affect stability, calcium binding affinity, or translocation to cell membranes (Ca2+/myristoyl switch). We obtained the first crystal structure of hippocalcin and alignment with other NCS proteins showed significant variability in the orientation of the C-terminal part of the molecule, the region expected to be important for binding to the target. We demonstrated that the disease-causing mutations did not affect the structure of the protein, but that both mutants exhibited an oligomerization defect. Furthermore, we observed increased calcium influx in KCl-depolarized cells expressing mutated hippocalcin, mainly due to voltage-gated N-type calcium channels. Our data demonstrate that dystonia-causing mutations strongly affect the cellular functions of hippocalcin, suggesting a central role for disrupted calcium signaling in DYT2 dystonia.\n",
      "Despite widespread clinical use in the treatment of type 2 diabetes, the impact of sulfonylurea treatment on cardiovascular outcomes remains unclear. Studies of natural genetic variations can be used to anticipate the expected clinical consequences of pharmacological therapy. A common missense variant of the gene encoding a component of the sulfonylurea receptor (ABCC8 p.A1369S) promotes closure of the target channel of sulfonylurea therapy and is associated with increased insulin secretion, thereby mimicking the effects of sulfonylurea treatment. Using individual data from 120,286 participants from the UK Biobank and summary association results from four large-scale genome-wide association studies, we examined the impact of this variant on cardiometabolic traits, type 2 diabetes and coronary heart disease. The p.A1369S variant was associated with a significantly lower risk of type 2 diabetes (odds ratio [OR] 0.93; 95% CI 0.91, 0.95; P = 1.2 x 10 (- 11)). The variant was associated with increased BMI (+0.062 kg/m(2); 95% CI 0.037, 0.086; P = 8.1 x 10(-7)) but lower adjusted waist-to-hip ratio for BMI, a marker of abdominal activity. fat distribution. Additionally, p.A1369S was associated with reduced risk of coronary heart disease (OR 0.98; 95% CI 0.96, 0.99; P = 5.9 x 10(-4)). These results suggest that, despite a known association with weight gain, long-term treatment with a sulfonylurea may reduce the risk of coronary heart disease.\n",
      "Intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) is a devastating disease with no effective treatment. After ICH, immediate leukocyte infiltration and microglia activation are accompanied by rapid upregulation of 18 kDa translocator protein (TSPO). TSPO ligands have shown anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective properties in models of CNS injury. In this study, we determined the impact of a TSPO ligand, etifoxine, on brain injury and inflammation in 2 mouse models of ICH. TSPO was upregulated in brain Iba1(+) cells from patients with ICH and in CD11b(+)CD45(int) cells from mice subjected to collagenase-induced ICH. Etifoxine significantly reduced neurological deficits and perihematoma brain edema after induction of ICH by injection of autologous blood or collagenase. In collagenase-induced ICH mice, etifoxine protection was associated with reduced leukocyte infiltration into the brain and microglial production of IL-6 and TNF-a. Etifoxine improved blood-brain barrier integrity and decreased cell death. Notably, the protective effect of etifoxine was abolished in mice lacking microglia through the use of a colony-stimulating factor 1 receptor inhibitor. These results indicate that the TSPO ligand etifoxine attenuates brain injury and inflammation after ICH. TSPO may be a viable therapeutic target that requires further investigation in ICH.-Li, M., Ren, H., Sheth, K. N., Shi, F.-D., Liu, Q. A TSPO ligand attenuates injury brain after intracerebral hemorrhage.\n",
      "The role of prostaglandin A2 (PGA2) in modulating vascular endothelial function is unknown. We investigated the effects of PGA2 on pulmonary endothelial cell (EC) permeability and inflammatory activation and identified a receptor mediating these effects. PGA2 enhanced the CE barrier and protected against barrier dysfunction caused by vasoactive peptide thrombin and proinflammatory bacterial cell wall lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Receptor screening using pharmacological and molecular inhibitory approaches identified EP4 as a novel PGA2 receptor. EP4-mediated barrier protective effects of PGA2 by activating Rap1/Rac1 GTPase and protein kinase A targets at cell adhesions and the cytoskeleton: VE-cadherin, p120-catenin, ZO-1, cortactin, and VASP. PGA2 also suppressed LPS-induced inflammatory signaling by inhibiting the NFkB pathway and the expression of EC adhesion molecules ICAM1 and VCAM1. These effects were abolished by pharmacological or molecular inhibition of EP4. In vivo, PGA2 was protective in two distinct models of acute lung injury (ALI): LPS-induced inflammatory injury and two-hit ALI caused by suboptimal mechanical ventilation and thrombin receptor-activating peptide injection . These protective effects were abolished in mice with endothelium-specific EP4 knockout. Results suggest a novel role for the PGA2-EP4 axis in protecting vascular EC, essential for ameliorating disease states associated with increased vascular leakage and inflammation.\n",
      "A heterozygous caveolin-1 mutation c.474delA was identified in a family with hereditary pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH). This frameshift mutation leads to a caveolin-1 protein that contains all known functional domains but only shows modification in the last 20 amino acids of the C-terminus. Here, we investigated how this mutation alters the function of caveolin-1, using patient-derived fibroblasts. Transmission electron microscopy showed that fibroblasts carrying the c.474delA mutation form typical caveolae. Expression of mutated caveolin-1 in caveolin-1 null mouse fibroblasts failed to induce caveolae formation due to retention of the mutated protein in the endoplasmic reticulum. However, coexpression of wild-type caveolin-1 with mutated caveolin-1 restored the ability to form caveolae. Importantly, the proliferation rate of fibroblasts carrying the mutation was increased twofold, associated with hyperphosphorylation of Smad1/5/8. This mutation impairs the antiproliferative function of caveolin-1. Inhibition of TGFb type I receptors ALK1/2/3/6 responsible for Smad1/5/8 phosphorylation reduced the hyperproliferation observed in c.474delA fibroblasts. These results demonstrate the critical role of the last 20 amino acids of caveolin-1 in modulating fibroblast proliferation by attenuating Smad signaling and suggest that increased Smad signaling and fibroblast hyperproliferation contribute to the pathogenesis of PAH in patients with caveolin-1 c.474delA. mutation.\n",
      "Pediatric high-grade gliomas account for 8-12% of all primary nervous system tumors in children. Five-year survival for these aggressive pediatric tumors is low (15-35%), indicating the need to develop better treatments for high-grade pediatric gliomas. In this work, we used SF188 and SJ-GBM2 cell lines to study the function of ubiquitin carboxyl-terminal esterase L1 (UCHL1), a deubiquitinase dysregulated in several cancers, in pediatric high-grade gliomas. Depletion of UCHL1 in SF188 and SJ-GBM2 glioma cells was associated with decreased cell proliferation and invasion, as well as a reduced ability to grow in soft agar and form spheres (i.e. a measure of self-renewal). A 70% reduction in Wnt signaling was also observed in SF188 and SJ-GBM2 UCHL1 knockdowns (KDs) using a TCF-dependent TOPflash reporter assay. Transcriptome comparisons of UCHL1 KDs versus vector control identified a list of 306 differentially expressed genes (at least 2-fold change; p < 0.05) that included genes known to be involved in cancer such as ACTA2, POSTN, LIF, FBXL7, FBXW11, GDF15, HEY2, but also potential new genes such as IGLL5, ABCA4, AQP3, AQP4, CALB1 and ALK. Gene ontology (GO) bioinformatics analysis of these 306 genes revealed significant enrichment in GO terms of “signal peptides,” “extracellular matrix,” and “secreted proteins.” “Angiogenesis and blood vessel development”, “neuron differentiation/development”, cell adhesion and “cell migration” also showed significant enrichment in our GO analysis. The main canonical pathways identified by Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) included “clathrin-mediated endocytosis”. Signaling” (p = 5.14x10-4), “Virus entry via endocytic pathways” (p = 6.15x 10-4) and “High Mobility Group-Box 1 (HMGB1) Signaling” (p = 6.15x10 -4). While FGF2, IL1B, TNF, and PDGFB were predicted as key upstream regulators (p<2x10-16) of the UCHL1 KD-associated transcriptome, aberrant UCHL1 expression in high-grade pediatric gliomas may promote invasion, transformation and cellular self-renewal. properties, at least in part, by modulating Wnt/Beta catenin activity, UCHL1 may act as an oncogene in glioma within the genetic network that confers stem-like characteristics to these cancer cells.\n",
      "Glucagon receptor (GcgR) blockade has been proposed as an alternative to insulin monotherapy to treat type 1 diabetes, because deletion or inhibition of GcgRs corrects hyperglycemia in diabetes models. The factors regulating blood glucose in a setting lacking insulin and glucagon function remain unclear, but may include the hormone ghrelin. Not only is ghrelin release controlled by glucose, but ghrelin also has many actions that can increase or decrease blood sugar levels. Here, we tested the hypothesis that ghrelin increases to prevent hypoglycemia in the absence of glucagon function. GcgR knockout mice (Gcgr(-/-)) and db/db mice that received the GcgR monoclonal antibody showed lower blood glucose levels accompanied by elevated plasma ghrelin levels. Although treatment with streptozotocin, a pancreatic B cell toxin, induced hyperglycemia and increased plasma ghrelin levels in wild-type mice, hyperglycemia was prevented in Gcgr(-/-) mice treated with similarly and the plasma ghrelin level increased further. Notably, administration of a ghrelin receptor antagonist further reduced blood glucose into the markedly hypoglycemic range in overnight fasted streptozotocin-treated Gcgr(-/-) mice. Decreased blood glucose levels were also observed in streptozotocin-treated, overnight-fasted ghrelin receptor-null mice administered the GcgR monoclonal antibody. These data suggest that when glucagon activity is blocked in the context of type 1 diabetes, plasma ghrelin levels increase, thereby preventing hypoglycemia.\n",
      "Increased production of free radicals has been documented in cases of group A streptococcal (beta-hemolytic) infection. By comparing 71 erysipelas patients to 55 age-matched healthy individuals, we investigated interactions between CAT, SOD1, and SOD2 single polymorphism (SNP) mutations with erysipelas susceptibility and serum cytokine levels. in the acute and recovery phases of erysipelas infection. While female patients had a higher predisposition to erysipelas, male patients were likely to have facial localization of infection. The presence of SOD1 G7958, SOD2 T2734 and CAT C262 alleles was linked to predisposition to erysipelas. The T and C alleles of SOD2 T2734C were individually associated with patients with bullous and erythematous erysipelas, respectively. The G and A alleles of SOD1 G7958A were individually associated with infection locations in the lower limbs and in the upper parts of the body. Serum levels of IL-1beta, CCL11, IL-2Ralpha, CXCL9, TRAIL, PDGF-BB, and CCL4 were associated with symptoms accompanying infection, while IL-6, IL-9, IL -10, IL-13, IL-15, IL-17, G-CSF and VEGF were associated with predisposition and recurrence of erysipelas. While variations in IL-1beta, IL-7, IL-8, IL-17, CCL5, and HGF were associated with the SOD2 T2734C SNP, variations in PDFG-BB and CCL2 were associated with the CAT C262T SNP.\n",
      "Diabetic cardiomyopathy (DCM) is a major complication and fatal cause of diabetic patients. Calcium-sensing receptor (CaSR) is a G protein-coupled receptor, which participates in maintaining calcium homeostasis, regulating cell proliferation and apoptosis, etc. In our previous study, we found that CaSR expression, intracellular calcium levels, and cardiac function were all significantly decreased in DCM rats; however, the exact mechanism is not yet clear. The present study revealed the protective role of CaSR in high glucose (HG)-induced myocardial energy metabolism disorders and the underlying mechanism. Here, we demonstrated that HG decreased the expression of CaSR, mitochondrial fusion proteins (Mfn1, Mfn2), cellular gap junction-related proteins (Cx43, beta-catenin, N-cadherin), and intracellular concentration. of ATP. In contrast, HG increased extracellular ATP concentration, expression of gp78, mitochondrial fission proteins (Fis1, Drp1), and ubiquitination levels of Mfn1, Mfn2, and Cx43. Furthermore, CaSR agonist and gp78-siRNA significantly reduced the above changes. Taken together, these results suggest that HG induces myocardial energy metabolism disorder via decreased CaSR expression and activation of the gp78-ubiquitin proteasome system. In turn, these effects disrupt the structure and function of mitochondria and the cellular gap junction, leading to reduced ATP synthesis and increased ATP leakage. CaSR stimulation significantly attenuates HG-induced abnormal myocardial energy metabolism, suggesting that CaSR would be a promising potential therapeutic target for DCM.\n",
      "N-acetylglucosamine (O-GlcNAc) transferase (OGT) regulates protein O-GlcNAcylation, an essential and dynamic post-translational modification. The O-GlcNAc modification is present on many nuclear and cytosolic proteins and has been implicated in essential cellular functions such as signaling and gene expression. Accordingly, altered levels of protein O-GlcNAcylation have been associated with developmental defects and neurodegeneration. However, OGT gene mutations have not yet been functionally confirmed in humans. Here we report two hemizygous OGT mutations in individuals with X-linked intellectual disability (XLID) and dysmorphic features: a missense mutation (p.Arg284Pro) and a mutation leading to a splicing defect (c.463-6T>G). . Both mutations reside in the tetratricopeptide repeats of OGT which are essential for substrate recognition. We observed slightly reduced levels of OGT protein and reduced levels of its opposing enzyme O-GlcNAcase in both patient-derived fibroblasts, but overall O-GlcNAc levels did not appear affected. Our data suggest that mutant cells attempt to maintain overall O-GlcNAcylation by downregulating O-GlcNAcase expression. We also found that the c.463-6T>G mutation leads to aberrant mRNA splicing, but no stable truncated proteins were detected in the corresponding patient-derived fibroblasts. Recombinant OGT carrying the p.Arg284Pro mutation was prone to deployment and exhibited reduced glycosylation activity against a complex set of glycosylation substrates and proteolytic processing of host cell transcription factor 1, which is also encoded by a gene associated with XLID. We conclude that defects in O-GlcNAc homeostasis and host cell factor 1 proteolysis may play a role in mediating XLID in individuals with OGT mutations.\n",
      "Endosomal sorting complex required for transport (ESCRT)-III mediates membrane fission in fundamental cellular processes, including cytokinesis. ESCRT-III is thought to form persistent filaments that, over time, increase their curvature to tighten membranes. Unexpectedly, we found that ESCRT-III in the midbody of human cells rapidly processes subunits with cytoplasmic pools while gradually forming larger assemblies. ESCRT-III turnover was dependent on the ATPase VPS4, which accumulated in the midbody simultaneously with ESCRT-III subunits, and was required for the assembly of functional ESCRT structures -III. In vitro, Vps2/Vps24 subunits of ESCRT-III formed side-by-side filaments with Snf7 and inhibited further polymerization, but growth inhibition was alleviated by the addition of Vps4 and ATP . High-speed atomic force microscopy further revealed highly dynamic networks of growing and shrinking ESCRT-III spirals in the presence of Vps4. Continuous remodeling of ESCRT-III by subunit turnover could facilitate shape adaptations to variable membrane geometries, with broad implications for diverse cellular processes.\n",
      "L-asparaginase is an essential chemotherapeutic agent for acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). It hydrolyzes plasma asparagine to aspartate and NH3, causing asparagine deficiency and inhibition of protein synthesis and, eventually, leukemia cell death. However, patient relapses often occur due to the development of resistance. The molecular mechanism by which ALL cells acquire resistance to L-asparaginase is unknown. Therefore, we sought to identify genes involved in L-asparaginase resistance in primary leukemia cells. Through an unbiased genome-wide RNAi screen, we found that among 10 resistant ALL clones, six hits were for mu opioid receptor 1 (oprm1), two hits were for carbonic anhydrase 1 (ca1) and two other results were for the ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme E2C. (ube2c). We also found that OPRM1 is expressed in all leukemia cells tested. Specific knockdown of OPRM1 confers resistance to L-asparaginase, thereby validating our genome-wide retroviral shRNA library screening data. Methadone, an OPRM1 agonist, enhances the sensitivity of parental leukemia cells, but not OPRM1-depleted cells, to L-asparaginase treatment, indicating that OPRM1 is required for the synergistic action of L-asparaginase and methadone, and that loss of OPRM1 promotes leukemia. cell survival is likely due to downregulation of the OPRM1-mediated apoptotic pathway. Consistent with this premise, leukemia cells from patients with relatively high levels of OPRM1 are more sensitive to L-asparaginase treatment than leukemia cells depleted of OPRM1, further indicating that loss of OPRM1 plays a role. crucial in L-asparaginase resistance in leukemia patients. Thus, our study demonstrates for the first time a novel OPRM1-mediated mechanism for L-asparaginase resistance in ALL and identifies OPRM1 as a functional biomarker to define high-risk subpopulations and for the detection of evolving resistant clones. . Oprm1 can also be used for the effective treatment of L-asparaginase-resistant ALL. Oncogene Advanced Online Publication, June 26, 2017; doi:10.1038/onc.2017.211.\n",
      "Liver metastases from colorectal cancer (CRC) are a clinically significant problem. The renin-angiotensin system is involved in tumor growth and metastasis. This study was designed to evaluate the role of angiotensin II subtype receptor 1a (AT1a) in the formation of liver metastases in CRC. A liver metastasis model was developed by intrasplenic injection of mouse colon cancer (CMT-93) into AT1a knockout mice (AT1aKO) and wild-type (C57BL/6) mice (WT). Compared with WT mice, liver weight and liver metastasis rate were significantly lower in AT1aKO. The mRNA levels of CD31, transforming growth factor b1 (TGF-b1), and F4/80 were suppressed in AT1aKO compared to WT. Double immunofluorescence analysis showed that the number of accumulated F4/80(+) cells expressing TGF-b1 in metastatic areas was higher in WT than in AT1aKO. AT1aKO (BM) bone marrow (AT1aKO-BM)>WT showed suppressed liver metastasis formation compared to WT-BM>WT. However, metastasis formation was suppressed more in WT-BM>AT1aKO compared to AT1aKO-BM>WT. Furthermore, F4/80(+) cells accumulated in liver metastases were not BM-derived F4/80(+) cells, but mainly resident F4/80(+) liver cells, and these liver cells resident F4/80(+) cells were positive for TGF-b1. Angiotensin II enhanced TGF-b1 expression in Kupffer cells. Treatment of WT with clodronate liposomes suppressed liver metastases by decreasing the accumulation of TGF-b1(+) F4/80(+) cells. Liver metastasis formation was correlated with collagen deposition in the metastatic area, which was dependent on AT1a signaling. These results suggest that resident hepatic macrophages induce the formation of liver metastases by induction of TGF-b1 via AT1a signaling.\n",
      "Recent data highlight the presence, in HIV-1 seropositive patients with lymphoma, of p17 (vp17) variants with B cell clonogenicity, suggesting a role for vp17 in lymphomagenesis. We studied the mechanisms responsible for the functional disparity on B cells between a wild-type p17 (refp17) and a vp17 named S75X. Here we show that a single Arginine (R) to Glycine (G) mutation at position 76 in the refp17 backbone (p17R76G), as in the S75X variant, is by itself sufficient to confer B cell clonogenic potential to the protein. viral. and modulate, via activation of the PTEN/PI3K/Akt signaling pathway, different molecules involved in the inhibition of apoptosis (CASP-9, CASP-7, DFF-45, NPM, YWHAZ, Src, PAX2, MAPK8), cell cycle promotion and cancer progression (CDK1, CDK2, CDK8, CHEK1, CHEK2, GSK-3 beta, NPM, PAK1, PP2C-alpha). Additionally, the single R to G mutation at position 76 was found to have a significant impact on protein folding and oligomerization by altering the hydrogen bond network. This generates a conformational change in the p17 R76G mutant that allows one or more functional epitopes, masked in refp17, to elicit signals promoting B cell growth after its interaction with one or more as yet unknown receptors. Our results provide new opportunities to understand the molecular mechanisms responsible for the B cell growth-promoting activity of vp17.\n",
      "Most hepatocellular carcinomas (HCCs) develop as a result of chronic inflammation of the liver. We showed that the oncoprotein gankyrin is essential for inflammation-induced tumorigenesis in the colon. Although the in vitro function of gankyrin is well known, its in vivo role remains to be elucidated. We studied the effect of gankyrin in the tumor microenvironment of mice with liver parenchymal cell-specific gankyrin ablation (Alb-Cre; gankyrin (f/f)) and gankyrin deletion in parenchymal cells and non-parenchymal liver (Mx1-Cre; gankyrin). (f/f) ). Gankyrin positively regulates the expression of vascular endothelial growth factor in tumor cells. Gankyrin binds to Src homology 2 domain-containing protein tyrosine phosphatase-1 (SHP-1), predominantly expressed in non-parenchymal liver cells, leading to phosphorylation and activation of the signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3). Gankyrin deficiency in non-parenchymal cells, but not in parenchymal cells, reduced STAT3 activity, interleukin (IL)-6 production, and cancer stem cell marker (Bmi1 and molecule d) expression. epithelial cell adhesion [EpCAM]), leading to attenuated tumorigenic potential. Chronic inflammation enhances gankyrin expression in human liver. Gankyrin expression in the tumor microenvironment negatively correlates with progression-free survival in patients undergoing sorafenib treatment for HCC. Thus, gankyrin appears to play an essential oncogenic function in the tumor microenvironment and could constitute a potential target for the development of therapeutic and preventive strategies against HCC.\n",
      "BACKGROUND Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) is common worldwide. GDM women exhibit inflammatory and metabolic abnormalities. However, few studies have focused on the association of IL-65-72C/G and TNF-alpha-857C/T single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), inflammatory biomarkers, and metabolic indices in women with of DG, especially in the population of Inner Mongolia. The aim of this study was to investigate the associations of IL-65-72C/G and TNF-alpha -857C/T SNPs and inflammatory and metabolic biomarkers in women who had a pregnancy with gestational diabetes. MATERIALS AND METHODS Blood and placenta samples from 140 women with GDM and 140 women with healthy pregnancies were collected. Matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF-MS) and MassARRAY-IPLEX were performed to analyze IL-65-72C/G and TNF-alpha-857C/T SNPs. An enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was performed to analyze inflammatory biomarkers and adipokines. RESULTS The distribution frequency of TNF-alpha -857CT (OR = 3.316, 95% CI = 1.092-8.304, p = 0.025) in women with GDM pregnancy was obviously higher than that in women with GDM pregnancy. healthy. Women with GDM were of older maternal age, had higher BMI, were more nulliparous, and had a history of T2DM and GDM, compared to women with healthy pregnancies (p<0.05). Serum (hs-CRP ratio, IL-6, IL-8, IL-6/IL-10) and placental inflammatory biomarkers (NF-kappaB ratio, IL-6, IL-8, IL-6/IL-10, IL -1b, TNF-alpha) were significantly different (p < 0.05) between women with GDM and women with healthy pregnancies. Differences were observed for serum FBG, FINS, HOMA-IR and HOMA-beta, as well as placental IRS-1, IRS-2, leptin, adiponectin, visfatin, RBP-4, chemerin , nesfatin-1, FATP-4, EL, LPL, FABP-1, FABP-3, FABP-4 and FABP-5. CONCLUSIONS TNF-alpha -857C/T SNP, hs-CRP, IL-6, IL-8, and IL-6/IL-10 were associated with gestational diabetes in women from Inner Mongolia, as do severe inflammation and disordered lipid and glucose metabolisms. .\n",
      "BACKGROUND: Increased g-globin gene expression and elevated fetal hemoglobin (HbF) production in patients with b-thalassemia are widely accepted to be associated with milder or even asymptomatic disease. Much attention has recently been paid to the search for HbF-associated polymorphisms (such as the first transfusion, the need for annual blood supply, the response to HbF inducers (the most studied of which is hydroxyurea). METHODS: Ag-globin gene sequencing was performed on genomic DNA isolated from a total of 75 b-thalassemia patients, including 31 b(0)39/b(0)39, 33 b(0) 39/b(+)IVSI- 110, 9 b(+)IVSI-110/b(+)IVSI-110, a b(0)IVSI-1/b(+)IVSI-6 and a b(0)39 /b(+)IVSI-6. RESULTS: The results show that the rs368698783 polymorphism is present in patients with b-thalassemia in the 5'UTR (+25) sequence of the Ag-globin gene, known to affect LYAR (human homolog of the antibody reactive clone Mouse Ly-1). 5'-GGTTAT-3' binding site. This Ag(+25 G->A) polymorphism is associated with the Gg-globin-XmnI polymorphism and both are linked to the b(0)39-globin gene, but not to the b(+)IVSI-110-globin gene. Consistent with the hypothesis that this mutation would alter LYAR binding activity, we found that the Ag(+25 G->A) and Gg-globin-XmnI polymorphisms are associated with elevated HbF in precursor cells. erythroids isolated from b(0)39. /b(0)39 patients with thalassemia. CONCLUSIONS: As a potential explanation for our results, we hypothesize that in b-thalassemia, the Gg-globin-XmnI/Ag-globin-(G->A) genotype is frequently genetically linked to mutations in b( 0)-thalassemia, but not with the b(+)-thalassemia mutation studied here (i.e. b(+)IVSI-110) and that this genetic combination was selected within the population of affected patients of b(0)-thalassemia, due to a functional association with elevated HbF. Here we describe the characterization of the rs368698783 (+25 G->A) polymorphism of the Ag-globin-associated gene in b(0)39 thalassemia patients with elevated HbF in erythroid precursor cells.\n",
      "Bicaudal D2 (BICD2) joins dynein and dynactin in a ternary complex (called DDB) capable of processive movement. Point mutations in the BICD2 gene have been identified in patients with a dominant form of spinal muscular atrophy, but it is unclear how these mutations cause the disease. To investigate this question, we developed in vitro motility assays with purified DDB and the membrane vesicular partner of BICD2, the GTPase Rab6a. Rab6a-GTP, either in solution or bound to artificial liposomes, released BICD2 from an auto-inhibited state and promoted robust dynein-dynactin transport. In these assays, BICD2 mutants showed an increased ability to form mobile DDB complexes. Increased retrograde transport by BICD2 mutants was also observed in cells using an inducible organelle transport assay. When overexpressed in rat hippocampal neurons, hyperactive BICD2 mutants decrease neurite outgrowth. Our results reveal that dominant mutations in BICD2 hyperactivate DDB motility and suggest that an imbalance between minus- and plus-end directed microtubule motility in neurons may underlie spinal muscular atrophy.\n",
      "Mutations in the NPHS2 gene, encoding podocin, cause hereditary nephrotic syndrome. The most common podocin mutation, R138Q, is associated with early disease onset and rapid progression to end-stage renal disease. Knock-in mice carrying an R140Q mutation, the murine analogue of human R138Q, exhibit arrested podocyte development and fatal renal failure at neonatal age. Here, we created a conditional model of podocin activation named NPHS2 R140Q/-, using a tamoxifen-inducible Cre recombinase, which allows studying the effects of the mutation in postnatal life. During the first week of R140Q hemizygosity induction, animals developed proteinuria, which peaked after 4–5 weeks. Subsequently, the animals developed progressive renal failure, with a median survival time of 12 weeks (95% CI: 11-13). Fusion of the foot processes was observed within a week, progressing to severe and global effacement over the course of the disease. The number of podocytes per glomerulus gradually decreased by up to 18% compared to healthy controls 12 to 16 weeks after induction. The fraction of segmentally sclerotic glomeruli was 25%, 85%, and 97% at 2, 4, and 8 weeks, respectively. Severe tubulointerstitial fibrosis was present in later stages of the disease and was quantitatively correlated with the level of proteinuria in the early stages of the disease. While podocin R140Q mRNA expression was high, protein abundance was reduced by more than 50% within 1 week of induction. While miRNA21 expression persistently increased during the first 4 weeks, miRNA-193a expression peaked 2 weeks after induction. In conclusion, the R140Q-podocin inducible mouse model is a propitious model of the most common genetic cause of human nephrotic syndrome, with a spontaneous disease course highly reminiscent of the human disorder. This model provides a valuable tool for testing the effectiveness of novel pharmacological interventions aimed at improving podocyte function and viability and attenuating proteinuria, glomerulosclerosis, and progressive renal failure.\n",
      "BACKGROUND:(Over)expression of arginase may limit the local availability of arginine for nitric oxide synthesis. We investigated the importance of arginase1 (ARG1) for the development of airway hyperresponsiveness (AHR) and lung inflammation in female mice with ovalbumin-induced allergic asthma (OVA). METHODS: Arg1 was knocked out in the lungs by crossing Arg1 fl/fl and Tie2Cre tg/- mice. OVA sensitization and provocation were performed, and methacholine assisted reproduction was determined using the Flexivent system. Changes in gene expression, chemokine and cytokine secretion, plasma IgE, and lung histology were quantified by RT-qPCR, ELISA, and immunohistochemistry, respectively. RESULTS: Ablation of Arg1 had no influence on OVA-induced AHR development, but attenuated OVA-induced increases in expression of Arg2 and Nos2, Slc7a1, Slc7a2, and Slc7a7 (arginine transporters), Il4, Il5 and Il13 (TH2-type cytokines). ), Ccl2 and Ccl11 (chemokines), Ifng (TH1-like cytokine), Clca3 and Muc5ac (goblet cell markers), and OVA-specific IgE. Pulmonary IL-10 protein content increased, but IL-4, IL-5, IL-13, TNFalpha and IFNgamma content, as well as lung histopathology, were not affected. Removal of Arg1 also decreased the number and strength of correlations between adaptive changes in lung function and inflammatory parameters in OVA/OVA-treated female mice. OVA/OVA-treated female mice showed a higher OVA-IgE response than males, but the correlation between lung function and inflammation was weaker. OVA-treated/Arginine-deficient OVA females differed from males in more pronounced decline in arginine metabolism and transport genes, higher plasma arginine levels, more OVA-specific IgE response low and no improvement in peripheral pulmonary function. CONCLUSION: Complete ablation of Arg1 in the lung affects mRNA abundance of arginine transport and metabolism genes and pro-inflammatory genes, but not methacholine responsiveness or accumulation of inflammatory cells.\n",
      "Salidroside (Sal) is an active ingredient isolated from Rhodiola rosea, which is believed to have anti-inflammatory activities and a renal protective effect. However, the role of Sal on renal fibrosis has not yet been elucidated. Here, the aim of the present study is to test the protective effects of Sal against renal interstitial fibrosis (RIF) and explore the underlying mechanisms using in vivo and in vitro models. In this study, we establish folic acid (FA)-induced unilateral ureteral obstruction (UUO) or renal interstitial fibrosis in mice in vivo and human proximal tubular epithelial cell (HK-2) cell model stimulated by folic acid (FA). transforming growth factor (TGF) beta1. in vitro. The levels of renal functional parameters and inflammatory cytokines in serum are examined. The degree of renal damage and fibrosis is determined by histological evaluation. Immunohistochemistry and Western blotting are used to determine the mechanisms of Sal against RIF. Our results show that Sal treatment can improve tubular injury and deposition of extracellular matrix (ECM) components (including collagen SH and collagen I). Additionally, Sal administration significantly suppresses epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), as evidenced by decreased expression of alpha-SMA, vimentin, TGF-beta1, Snail , slug, and largely restored expression of E-cadherin. Additionally, Sal also reduces the levels of serum biochemical markers (serum creatinine, Scr; blood urea nitrogen, BUN; and uric acid, UA) and decreases the release of inflammatory cytokines (IL-1beta, IL-6, TNF-alpha ). Further study revealed that the effect of Sal on renal interstitial fibrosis is associated with lower expression of TLR4, p-IkappaBalpha, p-NF-kappaB and mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPK), at both in vivo and in vitro. In conclusion, Sal treatment improves renal function, enhances the deposition of ECM components, and relieves the protein levels of EMT markers in mouse kidney and HK-2 cells. Furthermore, Sal treatment significantly decreased the release of inflammatory cytokines and inhibited TLR4/NF-kappaB and MAPK signaling pathways. Collectively, these results suggest that Sal administration may constitute a novel therapeutic strategy in the treatment of renal fibrosis.\n"
